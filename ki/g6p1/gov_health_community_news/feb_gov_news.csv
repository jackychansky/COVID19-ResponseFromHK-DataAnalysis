So there is a huge legitimate demand for that sort of cross-boundary travel.”Mrs Lam cited examples of legitimate and genuine cross-boundary trafficincluding Hong Kong workers who commute to the Mainland, mothers without the right of abode in Hong Kong travelling to the city to take care of their children, as well as the supply of food and other necessities.“Our strategy is really to consolidate as much as possible the existing control points. Now it is really down to, excluding the airport, only two - one isShenzhen Bay, the other is the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge - and the additional benefit of doing that is we are channelling all cross-boundary traffic into these two cross-boundary control points.And because of the inconvenience that we have caused to people as a result, the numbers will come down.”Mrs Lam noted the added benefit was government staff could be sent to the remaining open boundary control points.“We can release a rough estimate of about 1,000 civil servants from the other control points to be suspended from operation into these two remaining open control points. So they can do a much better medical surveillance, enquiries, temperature check in order to fulfil that same purpose of infection control. So this is really a balance that one has to strike, given Hong Kong’s very unique situation.”The Transport Department will implementspecial arrangements for cross-boundary transport servicesin view of the further closures of boundary control points.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200203/20200203_182410_508.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

It’s all pointing to minimising the people flow.  “All the measures that we have adopted in the last 10 days or so are focusing on this one single objective: we want to minimise and reduce very significantly the cross-border passenger traffic so as to reduce the chances of infection.

The programme heavily subsidises asymptomatic Hong Kong residents to undergo screening for colorectal cancer with no quota for participants.Moreover, the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme under the Centre for Health Protection, from the 2019-20 school year, now provides eligible female primary school students with human papillomavirus vaccine to prevent cervical cancer.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200204/20200204_115448_491.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

36,"February 7, 2020",Quarantine arrangement set,Health & Community,"(To watch the video with sign language interpretation, click here.)  The Government today explained its new 14-day quarantine arrangement to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Starting February 8, the Department of Health will issue quarantine orders to all people entering Hong Kong from the Mainland, including Hong Kong residents, Mainland residents and visitors from other places.  People meeting this criteria shall stay at home or other accommodation for a 14-day compulsory quarantine.  The policy includes people who have been to the Mainland in the past 14 days before arriving in Hong Kong, even if they entered the city via other places.  This applies to those who have not developed any symptoms and passed temperature checks upon entry.  Those showing symptoms will be referred to the department for further handling.  Travellers without a valid visa for a 14-day period will be denied entry.  For non-Hong Kong residents who have arranged to stay at hotels or other dwellings, they will conduct quarantine at the concerned hotels or dwellings.  If those under compulsory quarantinecannot arrange accommodation, the Government will providetemporary quarantine accommodation.  At this afternoon’s press conference, Secretary for Food & Health Sophia Chan said the goal of the policy is to safeguard the public.  “The objective of this mandatory home quarantine, with the legal backing, is to reduce the cross-boundary flow of people as well as to reduce the transmissibility of the virus within the community.  “The mandatory quarantine for 14 days, as the Chief Secretary alluded to earlier, there are a number of checks and medical surveillance, looking into the condition of quarantine at home.  “But the whole idea is for this person to stay at home and not go out, so that in case they are carrying any virus, it would not be transmitted to the rest of the community. So that’s the whole idea.”  Prof Chan further explained that those under quarantine will be monitored by the Department of Health.  “Other than all of these initial explanation packs, health education and telephone calls provided to the client, there will be spot checks, random checks to see whether this person is at home.  “Of course the condition of this person - whether for example they are running a temperature or they have any clinical signs and symptoms of not feeling well - would be checked and also for them to record themselves. There will be periodic checks by the Department of Health colleagues to monitor the situation.”  Prof Chan appealed to those placed in confinement to exercise self-discipline, stressing it will take a concerted effort to combat the virus.  “Of course, self-discipline is the most important because the whole idea is not to hold the person at home and have a lot of guards outside and so on.  “So it is not this. Self-discipline and then having everyone in Hong Kong fighting together for this infectious disease is the most important.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200207/20200207_190058_684.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Chief Executive Carrie Lam said today that 161 arrivals from the Mainland have been placed under mandatory quarantine since the new regulation came into effect at midnight.  During a press briefing, Mrs Lam said as at 4pm today, out of those 161 arrivals comprising 143 Hong Kong residents and 18 non-Hong Kong residents, 148 are under home quarantine, 11 are in hotels and the remainder are in two separate quarantine centres.  Hong Kong now has only three control points still in operation: Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay and Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.  Mrs Lam revealed as at 4pm today, 8,953 people arrived in Hong Kong via those three control points, with more than 90% coming from the airport, but not all of them fell under the mandatory quarantine regulation.  “Arrivals at the airport very often, will not be caught by the new regulation because they are not passengers arriving from the Mainland. But if those arrivals from international flights are passengers who have been in the Mainland for the past 14 days, they will still be caught by the new regulation.”  She added that not all passengers flying in from the Mainland were staying in Hong Kong and may be in transit at the airport.  As for the two land-based boundary control points at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Bay, as at 4pm today, there were 807 arrivals. Of these, 682 arrived via the bridge and 125 from the bay.  “A further breakdown will show you that of the arrivals through the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, many of them were Macau residents or Hong Kong people returning from Macau. And again, they are not caught by the regulation, because they are arrivals from Macau.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200208/20200208_190624_809.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
42,"February 9, 2020",Cruise quarantine completed,Health & Community,"The Centre for Health Protection today said all those on board the World Dream cruise ship docked in Hong Kong no longer need to be under surveillance for the novel coronavirus and may disembark.Some Mainland travellers who had earlier taken the cruise were confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus, so tests were conducted on all 1,800 crew members to safeguard the current passengers on board.The centre’s Chief Port Health Officer Dr Leung Yiu-hong told a press briefing at Kai Tak Cruise Terminal this afternoon that the crew’s test results came back negative.“The passengers on board actually had no contact with the confirmed cases on the cruise during January 19 to 24. Our plan was that, because the crew members currently on board may have had contact with these particular cases, and therefore, we are now clear that all the crew members have already tested negative for the virus, and so we consider that there is no need for any further surveillance or follow up for these passengers.”Dr Leung added that the Government made every effort to ensure the test results were conducted as swiftly as possible.“Because we have mobilised a lot of resources and manpower to collect the specimens of the crew members on board, and so we could manage to finish collection of all samples from the crew members in one day. I would also like to thank our laboratory colleagues who paid their very hard work and effort in processing all the specimens and testing within this short period.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200209/20200209_154250_608.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The Centre for Health Protection today urged the public to avoid large gatherings to prevent a community-wide outbreak of novel coronavirus infection.  The centre’s Communicable Disease Branch Head Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan made the appeal at a press conference after revealing that two of the three new confirmed cases had joined a hotpot and barbecue dinner with their family during the Lunar New Year holiday.  “Because we are in a situation where we would like to prevent a community-wide outbreak, so I would suggest we should avoid large dinner gatherings or lunch gatherings with friends or relatives. If it is necessary, for those who have symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms, they should avoid participating in these kinds of gatherings.”  She said the three new cases involve a 24-year-old man and his maternal grandmother who had attended the family gathering of 19 people in Kwun Tong. Seven other relatives who were at the dinner have also tested positive for the virus.  The third confirmed case is a 70-year-old man who had not travelled since January 9, but has underlying medical conditions.  Dr Chuang explained the difficulties of spotting people infected with the novel coronavirus.  “As you know from this family cluster, we know that many of them did not have obvious symptoms and some of them did not seek medical attention. Obviously some of them can still go to work or because of very mild symptoms they think they are okay. It is just like influenza. It is very difficult to pick up all those with mild symptoms and isolate them in the hospital and trace all those contacts, so the task is too big.”  She also pointed out that placing all patients under quarantine could at most delay the spread of the disease, but not completely stop it in its tracks.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200209/20200209_182846_297.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

It notedthe three quarantine centres, namely the MacLehose Holiday Village, the Lei Yue Mun Park & Holiday Village and Po Leung Kuk Jockey Club Pak Tam Chung Holiday Camp, have reached their maximum capacity.  The Government is actively preparing to convert theJao Tsung-I Academy's Heritage Lodge into the fourth quarantine centre.  When searching for the sites, the Government thoroughly considered whether the facilities meet the requirements for a quarantine centre including location, overall facilities and infrastructure, environment, the possible impact on nearbyresidents, as well as the time required for its operation.  It will also ensure that the operation of the quarantine centres meets the stringent requirements.  Security and healthcare staff will be on duty round the clock in the quarantine centres. A transfer service for leaving and entering the centres will be provided to people under quarantine, who will not take part in any community activities.  Entry into and departure from the quarantine centres are not allowed without written permission of health personnel.  According to the prevailing measures, patients confirmed to have been infected with or suspected to be infected by the novel coronavirus will be admitted to hospitals for isolation and treatment.  Whether being arranged to stay at quarantine centres or to be put under compulsory home quarantine, they are not confirmed or suspected cases. They are close contacts of confirmed cases or those who have been to Hubei Province in the past 14 days, and without any symptoms.  To prevent the transmission of the disease in the community with a view to achieving the highest effectiveness of the compulsory quarantine measures, the co-operation of the whole community is indispensable, the Government noted.  It added that the setting up of quarantine centres not only protects those under quarantine, but also safeguards everybody's health. Thus, it is hoped that the whole community can fight the disease together.

76,"February 17, 2020",Unite to fight virus,Health & Community,"Secretary for Justice Teresa ChengAfter the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the Government has announced a series of prevention and control measures to reduce the risk of spread of the disease in the community. Compulsory quarantine, on the basis of a public health emergency (under Cap. 599 Prevention & Control of Disease Ordinance), is one of the measures in place. From February 8 onwards, all people entering Hong Kong from the Mainland, including Hong Kong residents, Mainland residents as well as other visitors, are required to be subject to mandatory quarantine for 14 days upon their arrival. Even if they are entering from other places, if they have visited the Mainland over the past 14 days, mandatory quarantine is still applicable upon their arrival. Anyone who violates the regulation may face a maximum penalty of imprisonment for six months and a fine of $25,000 upon conviction. We hope that the new measures could further reduce the flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland, reducing the risks for a spread of the disease in Hong Kong.  The Department of Health would gather evidence and conduct investigations into any contravention of quarantine orders before referring the cases to the Department of Justice for making prosecutorial decisions. Our prosecutors would make such decisions based on available evidence, applicable laws and the Prosecution Code. A prosecution would be commenced if there is sufficient admissible evidence for a reasonable prospect of conviction.  Minimising social contact in the community is another key measure to curb the spread of the virus. Hence, we only arranged for a certain number of colleagues, including government counsel, paralegals and supporting staff, to return to the office to handle urgent matters and provide basic public services. The reception counters of the Prosecutions Division and the Civil Division have remained open over the past few weeks to allow members of the public and the legal profession to serve court documents. The shroff office is also partly open for payment service. Details of the service hours are available from our press release.  There are colleagues from different divisions returning to the office to handle emergency works including attending urgent court hearings, processing court documents and attending urgent meetings. We have arranged for sufficient manpower to provide cleansing services at the office to safeguard the health of colleagues. For others, who are given laptops and electronic communication devices, are advised to work at home. I am heartened to learn that the Department of Justice is largely functioning well.  The Judiciary announced that court hearings would be generally adjourned in view of public health considerations but the courts would continue to handle urgent and essential hearings. Colleagues from the Department of Justice have been deployed to attend such hearings to deal with cases including bail applications and sentencing.  I am grateful to all my colleagues for remaining steadfast at their posts at this difficult time. I also urge those who are required to stay at home or other dwelling places for a 14-day quarantine to abide by the law and strictly comply with the quarantine orders. Violation of orders causes a spread of the disease and leads to criminal prosecution. Last but not the least, I appeal to all members of the public to join hands with the Government to do their best to prevent and curb the spread of COVID-19 by maintaining good personal hygiene, thereby ending the epidemic as soon as possible.

At the meeting, members of the Scientific Committee on Emerging & Zoonotic Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Infection Control were updated on the latest global and local situation of the disease and reviewed the current surveillance and control measures in Hong Kong.  Members agreed that there is evidence of community transmission of the virus in the city.  To stop the disease’s spread and to prevent the virus from taking root locally, Hong Kong should continue to maintain the current strategy of isolating cases, quarantine of close contacts and medical surveillance of other contacts.  The two committees acknowledged that as the outbreaks in the Mainland are ongoing, the existing measures to minimise the population movements between Hong Kong and the Mainland should remain in place and be periodically assessed.  Regarding the quarantine period for contacts of confirmed cases, committee members recommended the period to be maintained at 14 days.  They advised that when quarantine centres have reached their full capacity, close contacts should be quarantined in designated quarantine facilities for the first 10 days while they could be put under home quarantine for the remaining four days on a case-by-case basis.  Social distancing measures, personal hygiene and environmental hygiene measures should be strengthened to minimise the further spread of the disease locally, committee members added.

One, is they may have difficulty in getting a commercial flight ticket. Because if people know that they come from this cruise, then there may be some worries.""Secondly is, even if they manage to take a commercial flight back, upon arrival at the Hong Kong International Airport they will be stopped by the Immigration Department because they will be put on the watch list.

How many are regarded as close contacts who may have to continue to stay in Japan? How many, if they are required to be quarantined, will be quarantined on the ship or on land?

Mr Cheung said the Hong Kong SAR Government is very concerned about the situation of Hong Kong people in the province and maintains close communication with them through the Hong Kong Economic & Trade Office in Wuhan (WHETO).  He noted that after receiving requests for assistance, the Hong Kong SAR Government plans on bringing Hong Kong people in Hubei back to the city.  However, given the number of residents in Hubei is not small and due to the current situation, their return will need to be arranged in batches.  Mr Cheung pointed out that the HKSAR Government is assessing, in a thorough and prudent manner, the risk on public health and the practicality of the operation.  Ithas to avoid cross-infection among the returnees on their way back to Hong Kong, he said, adding that quarantine arrangements for returnees upon their arrival also have to be considered.  ""We will proceed with caution and continue to co-ordinate and follow up with the relevant Mainland authorities. We will also maintain contact with the Hong Kong people in Hubei Province and provide them with every appropriate and practicable assistance, with a view to helping them return to Hong Kong as soon as possible.”  As of February 18, the HKSAR Government received more than 1,300 requests for assistance from Hong Kong residents in the province, involving more than 2,500 people scattering over 30 cities.  Mr Cheung explained that some of the Hong Kong people in Hubei, especially those with chronic illnesses, require medicine provided from Hong Kong.  The WHETO has co-ordinated with the Department of Health and contacted those in need to gather information about their medical history in Hong Kong to obtain the medicine that they need from the Hospital Authority or private medical practitioners through their relatives and friends in Hong Kong.  Given that these people are in different locations across the province, the medicine has to be further distributed to their places of residence after delivery to Wuhan. The HKSAR Government is working full steam ahead on this matter, he said.  Mr Cheung added that as of February 18, arrangements had been made to deliver medicine to 120 Hong Kong residents in Hubei.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200219/20200219_150416_140.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The Centre for Health Protection today described the difficultieswith identifying novel coronavirus patientsexhibiting mild symptoms.  The centre’s Communicable Disease Branch Head Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan used Hong Kong's latest coronavirus case as an example of howseveral patients initially display only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic.  “Case number 63 was not completely asymptomatic. After questioning, she had a runny nose and mild symptoms starting around February 14. I agree that it’s very difficult to trace and even identify such type of patients who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.  “If they have a known case contact, then it is still possible, sometimes, to identify them even if they have a previous history, such as the patient’s father and then case 63’s husband. He is now well, but for precautionary sake we put him in Tuen Mun Hospital for checking. But even at that, we may not pick up whether he really has symptoms or if he’s a confirmed case or not.”  And with that revelation, Dr Chuang stressed that the Hospital Authority is being more proactive.  “So we agree that it is very difficult to identify those with mild symptoms or asymptomatic carriers in the community.  “That is why the Hospital Authority has now put up standard laboratory testing in out-patient clinics in order to find out more and whether such patients exist in the community.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200219/20200219_164942_666.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung said that to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in schools and protect students'health, all schools temporarily suspended classes from early February. With the support of schools, students continue to learn at home during the class suspension.  ""To alleviate parents' burden, a funding of about $900 million will be allocated from the Anti-epidemic Fund to be set up shortly to provide an additional $1,000 to each recipient of the Student Grant for the 2019-20 school year, i.e. increase from $2,500 to $3,500. This measure will benefit parents of about 900,000 students. No extra applications are necessary.  ""We are already processing applications for the Student Grant in accordance with the original schedule. It is expected to effect payment of the first batch of the Student Grant of $3,500 within a week after the setting up of the Anti-epidemic Fund, followed by subsequent batches,"" Mr Yeung announced.  On supporting schools, the bureau will deploy existing resources to provide a one-off grant to all schools offering a full and formal curriculum to help them replenish their epidemic prevention equipment or clean their school premises and pay for other expenses related to epidemic prevention.  The provision is estimated to be $42 million, benefitting some 2,200 schools.  The subsidy rate ranges from $10,000 to $25,000 per school, depending on the type and size of the school.  The bureau will also provide a separate one-off additional grant for 21 aided special schools with a boarding section to guard against the epidemic.  The additional expenditure is estimated to be $2.25 million. The amount of the special grant is determined by their approved boarding capacity.  The bureau will also implement the measures for kindergartens, including using the student headcount in January this year as the basis for calculation of the monthly subsidy for those under thekindergarten education scheme during the class suspension period to ensure that there will be no reduction of government subsidies due to withdrawal of individual students during the period.  A lump sum grant will also be provided for all kindergartens, incurring an additional expenditure of $120 million.  The bureau will maintain close liaison with the school sector to continue to understand their concerns, follow up on the details of the above-mentioned measures and to provide appropriate support.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200220/20200220_114326_464.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Explaining the case, Dr Chuang said further tests on the dog would be conducted.  “According to AFCD colleagues, for confirmed human cases of novel coronavirus, if nobody can take care of their pets, their pets will be sent to AFCD for caring.  “AFCD colleagues have taken some samples for testing of the pets (concerned) and found out that one of the dogs tested as weak positive, so it is not sure whether the dog is really suffering from the infection or because of environmental contamination of the dog’s mouth and nose.  “So further tests will be conducted for the dog to check and until the test results are negative, the dog will not be returned to the owner.”  She advised pet owners to maintain good hygiene habits, wash their hands thoroughly before and after contact with their pets, and seek veterinarians’ advice as soon as possible if there are any changes in their pets’ health condition.  “If the infected case has a pet, we will ask the pet owner to allow the pet to be taken care of by the AFCD, so that they can be quarantined and tested from now on. Because we know that they might test positive, although we are not sure whether it is due to environmental contamination or it’s really infected.  “But as a precaution, we strongly advise all pet owners who are confirmed cases to allow us to send their pets to AFCD for quarantine and testing.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/02/20200228/20200228_174151_760.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
