Of course, advice from the CHP has been sought.”“For government offices, because the disease (number of new COVID-19 cases) has come down a bit, many services by the Government have to be provided.

14,"May 5, 2020",Some anti-epidemic measures eased,Health & Community,"(To watch the full press conference with sign language interpretation, click here.)Chief Executive Carrie Lam today said because Hong Kong has not reported a local COVID-19 case for over two weeks and imported cases are low, some anti-epidemic measures can be lifted.During a press conference, Mrs Lam outlined that unlike some European countries, Hong Kong did not need to go into lockdown to contain the spread of the disease.“Hong Kong has never gone into a stage of a complete city lockdown. In some of the European countries where they practise a city lockdown, residents are simply not allowed to leave their homes, except for some very essential purposes. But we have never adopted that practice.“And in fact, many renowned experts are now trying to study our situation - why does Hong Kong succeed in keeping the confirmed cases at a low level without drastic measures like a complete city lockdown. And I do think that is a very interesting topic for further research.”Mrs Lam noted that the Government had adopted the “suppress and lift” strategy under which restrictions are implemented and lifted in accordance with the infection situation.“The strategy that Hong Kong has been adopting - and advocated by some of our experts - is what we call a ‘suppress and lift strategy’.“So in light of the number of confirmed cases and likelihood of the spread of the disease in the community, we will have to suppress in order to make sure that there will be no surge in the number of confirmed cases as we have seen in some neighbouring regions.“When the situation of the infection stabilises, that is the time for lifting, that is, loosening a bit so that society can operate more normally, especially for the businesses and for individuals’ behaviour.”The Chief Executive said the Government still needed to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely, even though it was in the stage of lifting restrictions.“We are now right in the stage of lifting because we have not had a local case for 16 days already and the number of imported cases is very, very low.“We are now quite confident that the system of testing and holding that we have put in place for all arrivals from overseas would enable us to control the number of imported cases. So this is a time for lifting and this afternoon we have announced a number of lifting measures.“If the situation continues to stay at the current level - no local cases, very few imported cases - then at the end of the 14-day period, that is May 22, of course that would be the time for more relaxation.”Mrs Lam added that if a local case suddenly surfaced, Hong Kong may have to go back to some suppression measures, which was why the Government had to monitor the situation closely so it could take the necessary and pertinent response measures.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200505/20200505_170734_576.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Starting from Friday, up to eight people can gather in public places.""So raising the number from four to eight for the catering business and also for the prohibition against group gatherings under Cap 599G is not an exact science, but this is a step in the right direction of relaxation.""Maybe in another 14 days’ time we will raise the number of eight to 10, to 12, to 15 and so on.""Regarding bars and pubs, Mrs Lam said these venues will be able to reopen but the Government will put in place requirements to prevent physical interactions.""We have decided that perhaps to strike a pragmatic balance is to allow them to reopen for business but to put in far more stringent requirements.""Such requirements include no live music, band performances or dancing in bar premises.""That would be another way to keep the social distance and prevent as much as possible physical interactions.""Clickhere for the latest measures.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200505/20200505_171110_984.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

However, most stated that they had either stopped production, did not have enough stock, were unable to export materials due to export control, or unable to produce testing certification.The epidemic at that time was serious and the supplies of anti-epidemic items were becoming scarce. Hong Kong did not have any raw materials or production lines.Taking into account the aggressive procurement actions of anti-epidemic items by different countries, export control and suspension of production lines all over the world, the Government had to consider urgently the feasibility of manufacturing reusable masks that would be up to standard for use by the whole community.On reviewing the reusable mask developed by the HKRITA, the Government considered that the design of the mask and materials used could meet the requirement, as there were supporting certifications proving its compliance with relevant international standards.As for mass production, it depends on the availability of supply of raw materials. Having wide network in the industry, the HKRITA was able to acquire quality raw materials within a short period and put production lines in place.The Government therefore commissioned the HKRITA to oversee the coordinationof production through direct purchase with a view to supplying reusable masks to all Hong Kong residents as soon as possible.The bureau added the HKRITA is a non-profit-making R&D centre fully subsidised by the Government, with most of their R&D projects funded by the Innovation & Technology Fund.The HKRITA oversees the CuMask project on a non-profit-making basis. All expenses will be reimbursed to the HKRITA on the basis of actual spending.People concerned withthe effectiveness of the CuMask may browse the website for testing reports and patent information.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200507/20200507_132114_106.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Up to 50,000 genomes would be sequenced.""The objective of this genome project, not only is it going to develop genomic medicine as a whole, but we are going to use this as a catalyst. Hopefully this project can, at the same time, come up with a database and secondly, build capacity within Hong Kong so that we have more people who are able to work on this.“Ultimately, this is not only for the benefit of science and data development, but also I think in the long run or even in the process, this would benefit our patients - the diagnosis of patients and treatment of patients.“There is a lot already happening now in hospitals in terms of using genomic medicine and sequencing in looking at diagnoses and also treatments. But these are on a smaller scale.""Prof Chan added that $1.2 billion has been set aside toexecute the Hong Kong Genome Project.“The Hong Kong Government and the Food & Health Bureau feel that this is important in terms of the development of genomic medicine for future development, not only for research but also for diagnosis and treatment, ultimately benefitting our patients.”The bureau will co-ordinate the implementation of the report’s recommendations with stakeholders including the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority, universities, medical and relevant professional bodies and private sectors.Click here for the report’s details.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200514/20200514_151627_889.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

What they have to do is provide consent so that our processing agent can obtain the relevant information from the trustees of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Schemes.“All those records are historical records, so there is no particular declaration that is required. Also, there will be no exaggerations or manipulation of data so to speak, because all these things were already part of the history by the time that we announced the details of this scheme.“(Employers) will be required to submit the relevant information after they have received the subsidy, so that is the checkpoint. By the time they are applying for the second tranche, they should be able to provide the information for June and for July too.”The scheme's subsidy period is from June to August and employers who apply for the wage subsidy must have contributed to their employees’ MPF or Occupational Retirement Schemes that were set up on or before March 31.“From June to August, for the first tranche, all the relevant information will be part of the history. After that time, they will be required to provide the information again through the trustees to our processing agent for us to double check the information,” Dr Law noted.Employers joining the scheme have to provide an undertaking not to implement redundancies during the subsidy period and spend all wage subsidies from the Government in paying wages to their employees or face being penalised.They will be penalised if the number of employees on the payroll in any one month of the subsidy period is smallerthan the number of staff in March. The penalty percentage varies according tothe number of people employed.If an employer fails to use all the wage subsidies received for a particular month during the subsidy period to pay employees' wagesin the same month, the Government will claw back the unspent balance of the subsidy.“I can add one very minor point in terms of the procedure. Because there will be two tranches of the subsidy, the penalty or the claw back for administration can be applied to the second tranche subsidy.“Instead of getting the money back directly, we can deduct them in the second tranche. But for the second tranche, the claw back or penalties, we will definitely have to go back to the employers and ask them to give us back the money. It is slightly different in the first and the second tranche arrangement.”Click here for more details.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200518/20200518_181706_214.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The Government will review relevant implemented measures from time to time having regard to the development of the epidemic situation.On the one hand some social distancing measures will be maintained, but on the other hand there will be room for gradual resumption of social activities, with suitable adjustments made to social distancing measures after considering all relevant factors.The Government emphasised that it does not rule out gradual relaxation of restrictions on group gatherings subject to the epidemic situation, for example, by adjusting the maximum number of people allowed at a group gathering or introducing additional categories of exempted group gatherings.Before the global epidemic is fully under control, the Government calls on the public to stay vigilant, maintain an appropriate social distance from others, and adopt precautionary measures in crowded places to cut the virus transmission chain.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200520/20200520_104940_224.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

76,"May 25, 2020",Striking the right balance in virus fight,Health & Community,"Chief Executive Carrie LamIn Hong Kong, two terms have emerged in the prevention and control of COVID-19. One is suppress and lift, the strategy we use to formulate our anti-epidemic plan. The other is three-way tug of war, a metaphor illustrating the need to carefully consider the three factors of public health, economic impact and social acceptance in devising the appropriate measures. These two terms are very often related to the question of whether we are able to strike the right balance and make flexible adjustments to control measures. While the Government attaches great importance to the professional advice of every member of our expert advisory panel, striking the right balance is not an exact science; my colleagues and I, as well as non-official members of the Executive Council, having taken into account various factors and listened to views from various sectors, have to make the most appropriate decision.Developments of the epidemicHong Kong’s epidemic situation has stabilised since mid-April. Excluding imported cases, no local infections were recorded for 23 consecutive days from April 20 to May 12. This shows that the anti-epidemic efforts of the Government and various sectors of the community have yielded encouraging results. The number of infected patients discharged from hospital has also increased. As at May 24, there were only 32 confirmed patients in hospital. The pressure on hospitals has been reduced significantly.However, a cluster of three local infection cases emerged in mid-May, and the infection source remains unknown. Although we have not yet seen signs of further community spread, the emergence of sporadic local cases suggests there are still undetected infections in the community and hence, a risk of transmission. We have to stay alert to prevent a rebound of the epidemic.Anti-epidemic effortsApart from the few sporadic local cases, we continue to see imported cases arising from Hong Kong residents returning from overseas. Yet, the risk is generally manageable, and our quarantine and hospital bed facilities are relatively adequate. An increasing number of experts have pointed out that, given the nature of COVID-19, it is difficult to achieve the target of no local cases within a short period of time. Some even believe that before effective vaccines are successfully developed, or before the majority of the population develop antibodies, governments and people around the world will have to get used to the intermittent emergence of sporadic local cases for some time to come. In addition, with stringent social distancing measures having been in place for over a month, people were anxious to go back to a normal life as quickly as possible; suspension of public services and economic activities also should not last for too long. After balancing various factors, the Government started to relax anti-epidemic measures in a moderate and phased manner from early May, including the gradual return to normal operation for public services, lifting certain restrictions on business operations, and the phased resumption of classes.We remain very cautious in relaxing social distancing measures. The decision on the types of businesses and social activities allowed to reopen or resume was based on a thorough assessment. Those engaged in these businesses and social activities have to comply with epidemic control requirements formulated by relevant bureaus and departments in consultation with stakeholders. Major measures implemented by the Government in response to developments over the past month are set out below.Date EventApril 27The Food & Health Bureau approved funding of $111 million from its Health & Medical Research Fund to support the medical schools of The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong to conduct 26 medical research studies on COVID-19, including the development of vaccines and novel antiviral drugs.April 28The Government announced that virtually all civil servants and public services would return to normal working or operating hours from May 4.April 28The Government announced the extension of compulsory quarantine for people arriving from the Mainland, Macau and Taiwan for one month to June 7; the broadening of exemption to cover cross-boundary students and related service providers as well as cross-boundary travellers whose manufacturing operations, business activities or provision of professional services are in the interest of Hong Kong’s economic development; and the empowering of the Director of Health to cancel the quarantine orders against people arriving from the Mainland or Macau under certain conditions.April 30The Government arranged a chartered flight to bring back 319 Hong Kong residents stranded in Pakistan. They were required to take a viral test before starting compulsory quarantine for 14 days at the designated quarantine centre.May 5The Government announced that the statutory measures on social distancing would be extended for 14 days to May 21. At the same time, some control measures would be relaxed, including increasing from four to eight the number of people allowed in group gatherings; increasing from four to eight the number of people allowed to be seated together at one table in catering premises; allowing the reopening, subject to compliance with certain requirements, of seven types of business premises including amusement game centres, fitness centres, places of amusement, places of public entertainment (such as cinemas), beauty parlours, massage establishments and mahjong-tin kau premises; allowing bars and pubs to resume operations subject to compliance with more stringent requirements; while karaoke establishments, bathhouses, party rooms, clubs and night clubs would remain closed for 14 days.May 5The Government announced the phased resumption of classes for schools. For S3 to S5 students, P4 to S2 students and K3 to P3 students, classes would resume on May 27, June 8 and June 15 respectively. For K1 and K2 students, classes would not resume this academic year. International schools can gradually resume classes. The Government would consider the issue of cross-boundary students separately and make arrangements accordingly.May 5The Government announced six measures to increase the supply of masks, including the distribution of one reusable CuMask to each Hong Kong citizen and 10 disposable masks to each household. The Government would continue to provide masks for the care staff of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) and residential care homes for persons with disabilities (RCHDs), frontline cleaning workers engaged by the Government’s outsourced service contractors, the elderly, the disadvantaged, etc.May 11The Department of Health (DH) arranged for Hong Kong residents who had been stranded in areas of unknown epidemic situation such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and South Africa and who had returned to Hong Kong (including those arriving by Government-arranged charter flights or other flights) to take a viral test before undergoing compulsory quarantine for 14 days at the quarantine centre.May 12The Hospital Authority started to conduct viral tests on samples collected from asymptomatic inpatients who are residents at RCHEs, RCHDs and nursing homes as well as patients admitted to psychiatric wards. At the same time, the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Programme was extended to include all inpatients at public hospitals with influenza-like illness symptoms.May 13The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) announced that from May 15 the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Programme would be extended to provide free viral tests for those working at the Hong Kong International Airport. Staff members working at RCHEs and RCHDs under the Social Welfare Department would also be tested if they had mild symptoms.May 13Following a local case involving three family members, the CHP distributed about 3,000 deep throat saliva sample bottles to their relatives and friends, nearby residents and hawkers. Test results of over 2,200 samples received were all negative.May 15The University Grants Committee provided an additional funding allocation of $250 million to support group research projects related to COVID-19 and other novel infectious diseases.May 18The Government arranged a chartered flight from New Delhi to bring back 249 Hong Kong residents stranded in India. They were required to take a viral test before undergoing compulsory quarantine for 14 days at the quarantine centre.May 19The Government announced that the prohibition of group gatherings with more than eight people in public places would remain in force until June 4, with a broadening of exemption to cover religious gatherings. In addition, the anti-epidemic requirements for fitness centres and places of public entertainment were adjusted. Bathhouses, party rooms, clubs or night clubs and karaoke establishments would remain closed until May 28.May 19The Leisure & Cultural Services Department announced that leisure facilities including most public swimming pools and barbecue sites would reopen on May 21, and beaches would be opened progressively from May 23.May 19The Government announced the stepping up of community surveillance by striving to enhance the public laboratory testing capacity to 7,000 viral tests a day as soon as possible. The DH started on May 20 to distribute sample bottles to RCHEs, RCHDs and nursing homes with the aim of testing 3,000 workers within this month. Apart from the designated Chinese medicine clinics in the 18 districts, the DH would also provide sample bottles for the public at the Kwai Tsing District Health Centre on a pilot basis.Some in the community opined that the Government’s decision on prohibiting group gatherings was politically driven. Such a claim is totally unfounded. Adjustment to control measures is always based on public health considerations in terms of risk assessment of virus transmission and the advice of public health experts both inside and outside the Government. Even though we need to take into consideration factors like economic impact and social acceptance, we remain always mindful of not undermining our anti-epidemic efforts. The vast majority of Hong Kong people understand the rationale behind this, and some are in favour of a stringent rather than loose approach at the expense of organising or taking part in large-scale leisure, cultural or festive events.Future work prioritiesAlthough the epidemic situation has eased, we will not drop our guard. We will introduce appropriate measures in response to changes in global and local epidemic situation. We are currently focusing our efforts on the following:(1) Stepping up viral testing. People arriving from overseas are required to take a viral test, and only those who test negative can then proceed to compulsory quarantine. This is an effective way to prevent people infected overseas from causing community infection. Due to the local infection cases with unknown source in mid-May, the CHP is stepping up viral testing as recommended by experts to ascertain the presence of the virus in the community. We are enhancing testing capacity in different ways, including purchasing additional equipment for the Public Health Laboratory Centre (PHLC) and extending the working hours of PHLC before the equipment is put into operation; allocating funding to the medical schools of The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong to purchase the necessary equipment; and contacting private laboratories in the hope that they can also enhance their testing capacity. Our current target is to enhance the testing capacity of public institutions to 7,000 viral tests a day as soon as possible so we can identify and cut the potential virus transmission chain in the community.(2) Adopting a multi-pronged approach to increase supply of masks. As the epidemic may last for some time, people still need to continue to wear masks on various occasions. Regarding the reusable CuMask distributed to each Hong Kong citizen, so far more than 3.6 million people have registered for it and 2.9 million masks have been delivered by Hongkong Post. Next month, we will distribute disposable masks to the public for free, and will strive to continue to provide masks for those in need, including students, care staff of residential care homes, frontline cleaning workers, the elderly and the disadvantaged.(3) Supporting businesses and individuals affected by the epidemic. The Government is implementing the two rounds of measures under the Anti-epidemic Fund and the relief package announced by the Financial Secretary in the Budget as soon as possible to help businesses and individuals tide over the economic winter. Among them, the Government has launched the Employment Support Scheme (ESS) in response to the worsening unemployment situation (the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 5.2% between February and April 2020, the highest in more than 10 years). The ESS is now open for applications to provide wage subsidies to help employers retain their employees and first payments will be disbursed in the latter half of June at the earliest.(4) Continuing to adjust border control and social distancing measures. We will continue to carefully adjust social distancing measures having regard to the epidemic situation and the effects on the economy, livelihoods and the daily lives of people. If circumstances allow, we will actively consider a gradual relaxation of restrictions on group gatherings, such as adjusting the maximum number of people allowed or introducing additional categories of exempted group gatherings. For the hundreds of thousands of students affected by class suspension over the past several months, classes will resume in phases from May 27 onwards. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to principals and teachers for the huge efforts they have made in preparing for class resumption.Fighting the virus togetherFighting the virus is a long battle. We have to maintain the effectiveness of our anti-epidemic efforts while addressing the needs of individuals and businesses. Faced with a weak economy and a rapidly deteriorating employment situation, let’s continue to act in the same spirit of solidarity to get Hong Kong back to stability as early as possible.Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued thisarticle entitled Four Months into Our Fight Striking the Right Balance on May 25.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200525/20200525_155118_587.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

88,"May 28, 2020",Smoking increases COVID-19 risk,Health & Community,"Cigarette smokers are more at risk of contracting severe diseases, including COVID-19, the Department of Healthsaid today.The department made the remarks as the Tobacco & Alcohol Control Office held a press conference this morning on the correlation between smoking and the coronavirus.Office head Dr Fung Ying explained that conventional cigarettes, the most common form of tobacco in Hong Kong, contain carcinogens that erode the body’s immunity to diseases.“The toxicants in conventional cigarettes will lower body resistance and they also cause a hypoxic state in general because they constrict vessels and weaken the immune system.“So overall, smokers have a high risk of respiratory infection, they are also at high risk of severe diseases. That is true for many infectious diseases, not only this coronavirus.“Smoking will weaken the body's immune system and it also causes damage to body cells that will weaken the body’s ability to withstand the stress from infections.”Dr Fung also warned that those who partake in waterpipe smoking are exposed to the same toxic chemicals found in conventional cigarettes.She added that due to its design, waterpipe smokers may inhale even more toxins which accelerates the spread of infectious diseases.“It contains similar toxicants as conventional cigarettes so these toxicants will weaken your immune system and weaken your respiratory system.“Secondly, because the apparatus of the waterpipe has many parts, it’s very difficult to disinfect these parts after use.“And also, because there’s a water bowl and steam, it facilitates the growth and spread of microorganisms. So overall, waterpipe smoking increases the risk of spread of infectious diseases.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/05/20200528/20200528_143051_218.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
