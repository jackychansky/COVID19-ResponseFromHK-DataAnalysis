23,"January 9, 2020",CHP gives update on Wuhan cases,Health & Community,"The Mainland's expert group has preliminarily determined that the pathogen of the cluster of viral pneumonia cases occurring in Wuhan is a kind of novel coronavirus.  Centre for Health Protection Controller Dr Wong Ka-hing gave the remarks at a press conference this evening on the latest progress of the identification of the pathogen for the reported cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.  Dr Wong said that according to information from the National Health Commission, the relevant Mainland laboratory has detected a novel coronavirus and obtained the whole genome sequence of the virus.  The expert group revealed that molecular testing of 15 cases returned positive resultsfor the novel coronavirus, and the virus was also isolated from a sample of a case. Under electron microscopy, the virus showed the typical appearance of coronavirus.  It added that the testing for nucleic acid, genome and antibodies from the samples of patients could be completed within a short period, thereby assisting in the confirmation of the pathogen.  Nonetheless, the virus isolation and pathogenicity studies would take several weeks.  Dr Wong said the Centre for Health Protection’s Public Health Laboratory Services Branch is conducting molecular testing for a number of coronaviruses.  “The Department of Health has contacted the National Health Commission after their notification today to ask if they can give us the genetic sequencing of the novel coronavirus so that we can have a more targeted and accurate testing of the novel virus for the suspected patients.  “The severity of this new disease is apparently not as severe as that of SARS. But of course, the information is still evolving.  “The existing prevention and control measures that we have implemented and also augmented have quite rightly been targeting this novel disease, but I would remind the public not to take this lightly.”  Additionally, the Scientific Committee on Emerging & Zoonotic Diseases and the Scientific Committee on Infection Control under the Centre for Health Protection convened a joint meeting today.  The committees noted that definite evidence of human-to-human transmission had not been identified in the Mainland so far and no healthcare professionals had been found infected.  However, the committees’ members considered that the available epidemiological information is not sufficient at this stage to reach a conclusion.  They concurred with the assessment of the World Health Organization that the reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market in Wuhan could indicate an exposure link to animals.  They also agreed that public education should be strengthened in urging people not to consume game meat and not to patronise food premises where game meat is served.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/01/20200109/20200109_201604_565.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The centre received notification from the commission this morning on the latest information concerning the cluster of pneumonia cases detected in Wuhan.  It said after the preliminary determination that the pathogen of viral pneumonia with unknown cause is a novel coronavirus, national and provincial expert groups immediately revised and improved the protocols on diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of the viral pneumonia.  The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has arranged the samples of existing patients to be tested for nucleic acid of the pathogen, and the expert groups have made overall assessments on the patients hospitalised for observation and treatment, taking into consideration clinical picture findings, epidemiological information and laboratory test results, etc.  As of January 10, a total of 41 patients have been diagnosed with having the novel coronavirus infection. Among them, two patients were discharged, seven are in serious condition and one died, while the remaining patients are in stable condition. No new cases have been seen since January 3.  A total of 739 close contacts have been identified and 419 of them are healthcare workers. All have been put under medical surveillance and no related cases have been detected so far.  The Mainland's investigation has neither identified any infection of healthcare workers nor definite evidence of human-to-human transmission.  According to information from the NHC, epidemiological investigations revealed that the patients are mainly business operators at Hua Nan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has been closed since January 1, the centre added.  In Hong Kong, the centre’s Port Health Division has strengthened port health measures and enhanced temperature screening of travellers with increased frequency of random checking at all boundary control points.  An additional thermal imaging system has been put in place at the Hong Kong International Airport dedicated for temperature screening of travellers from flights arriving from Wuhan.

That represents about 2% of the total operating expenditure of the Government.“But it also reflects our commitment to improve the living conditions of disadvantaged people and the elderly. I think we should not look at it in terms of short-term deficits. By the way, these measures are supported by the Financial Secretary himself.""The Chief Executive said the Government will not be hindered by concerns over fiscal deficits in implementing the measures that are considered justified.“So on the one hand, we have a lot of aspirations from society about more work to be done by the Government in improving the livelihood of these people, so that they can share the benefits of economic growth.“But to say that because we are now having an economic recession, that is why although we feel that these are justified measures, that we would not do it because of worries over fiscal deficits, I do not think that is a very positive way of dealing with the situation.”Mrs Lam called on citizens to have confidence in Hong Kong overcoming its current difficulties.""At the end of the day, I think we should and I would advocate that we should have confidence in Hong Kong. Hong Kong will rebound after these months of social unrest and we have a lot of opportunities in front of us that will give us more economic growth in the time to come to enable us to afford these measures to support the livelihood of the disadvantaged, so that is the position that we take.""Citingthe initiative to lower the eligible age for the $2 transport fare concession scheme from the current 65 to 60 as an example, Mrs Lam said there was a breakthrough in the Government’s thinking.“Of the 10 measures that we now propose, I am sure you will be able to find our previous different positions on some of these measures from expressing reservations to perhaps even resisting those proposals or aspirations from the political parties or members of the public.“But I have to say that we are having sort of a breakthrough in our thinking - that we should be listening more to the people, we should display more humility, that instead of we are right always, we should listen to the people to what they have to tell us in terms of ensuring that Hong Kong will be a more inclusive and harmonious society and that different sectors of society will be able to share the benefits of Hong Kong’s economic growth and prosperity.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/01/20200114/20200114_162923_767.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

This brings the total number of patients to 236,of which 119 remain hospitalised.  “We are now under very high pressure and in a very tight situation in terms of bed provision and manpower provision,”he said, adding that the increase in reported cases has placed a lot of pressure on isolation wards.  The Centre for Health Protection revised the reporting criteria of Severe Respiratory Disease associated with a Novel Infectious Agent to enhance the surveillance of suspected cases.  Dr Chungsaid the authority's seven hospital clusters are exploring theirresources to deal with the corresponding jump in hospital intake, and that the cluster representatives said during a meeting this morning that isolation ward occupancy is reaching capacity.  “They are now mobilising some of the other facilities that we have reserved to turn them into negative pressure rooms and mobilise patients and resources so that we can now increase our number of isolation beds that can be operated from 500 to 570 and isolation rooms from 290 up to 309.  “But even with that amount of isolation rooms, the occupancy is still more than 70%. So it is a very high occupancy and they are trying to mobilise more over these coming few days.”  DrChung also spoke on the short-term accommodation needs of hospital staff who are worried about returning homeafter treating novel coronavirus infection patients.  “Our staff are also concerned that if in case they have to take care of more confirmed cases, some of them feel worried if they need to go home after work.”  He said the authority's clusters have set aside more than 260 beds for staff to use overnight after finishing their shifts, adding that more accommodation is being sought for this purpose.  “We are trying to mobilise more and we are trying to actually see whether in society, like inhotels, we can hire more rooms for our staff for accommodation.  “We have good news that a few hotels already said they would try their best to help.”  The Centre for Health Protection will update the reported cases of novel coronavirus infection on itsdedicated webpage at 9am and 6pm every day.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/01/20200124/20200124_143217_066.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The Government did not delay actions in combatting the spread of the novel coronavirus due to non-health reasons, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said today.  Mrs Lam made the statement at a press conference in the afternoon, during which she announced the decision to raise Hong Kong’s response level to the emergency level andmeasures to prevent the virus’ spread.  She pointed out that the Government has taken actions in a very systematic manner based on scientific evidence and advice from experts.  Mrs Lam explained that the city reached a critical point on January 23 when two confirmed cases of novel coronavirus were announced.  “At each stage, the Government’s actions and reactions have to take into account the latest development, the severity of the public health situation and the advice that we receive from our experts.  “So, I thought that was a very simple sequence of events. There was absolutely no intention or plan to delay actions because of other non-health reasons. It also has nothing to do with my absence from Hong Kong.”  Mrs Lam added that she was in close contact with the Chief Secretary and the Secretary for Food & Health while she was visiting Davos, Switzerland, to attend this year’s World Economic Forum.  She also refuted the allegation that the Government did not listen to experts.  Responding to a question on whether the Government will continue its appeal against a court ruling on the anti-mask law, Mrs Lam said the ruling has nothing to do with public health.  “The appeal against the court decision was not so much on the anti-mask regulation made under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO).  “It’s an appeal to make sure that there is still this constitutional validity of the ERO because for any government, for the executive not to have any powers of that sort, it could in a way impede us in responding to emergency situations.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/01/20200125/20200125_191553_178.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung made the statement at a press conference today on measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Classes will resume on February 17 for kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools and special schools.

During the originally scheduled school days, schools should keep their premises open and arrange staff to be on duty to look after students who have to go back to school, handle school affairs and parents’ enquiries.  Schools should also cancel scheduled examinations, tests and activities and make appropriate rearrangements.  Mr Yeung said: “We call on students to stay at home as far as possible during the extended period of school holidays.  “Schools can provide learning materials to students through emails, school homepages and other effective means, including online resources from Hong Kong Education City and other educational websites to facilitate students’ self-learning at home.  “We call on parents to enhance home-school co-operation and take proper care of their children, pay more attention to environmental and personal hygiene and avoid allowing their children to go to overcrowded places so as to reduce the risk of infection.”  Regarding arrangements for the provision of a $2,500 grant to day-school students in the 2019-20 school year, the bureau will extend the deadline for submission by two weeks from February 14 to February 28.

They are Hong Kong-based companies but they are operating and manufacturing on the Mainland. That’s why we are facilitating with the relevant ministries, customs and so on, to ensure that they can arrive in Hong Kong on time and also in adequate amount.”The Chief Secretary also pointed out that there is a shortage on the Mainland and that the situation is very tense.“It’s not just Hong Kong or China. In fact, it’s a global issue. Even the World Health Organization recognises that the shortage of masks hits many, many countries in the world.”Additionally, Chief Executive Carrie Lam convened the fourth meeting of the Steering Committee & Command Centre in relation to the novel coronavirus.Having regard to the advice of experts, the Steering Committee & Command Centre considered that it is necessary to prioritise the supply of surgical masks and that priority should be given to healthcare workers and personnel providing care services, people providing essential services and other members of the public with practical needs.In a statement, the Government pointed out that all relevant departments and the Hospital Authority (HA) have maintained a certain number of masks. However, their consumption rate over the past month was up to six times the previous rate.The current stockpile of masks kept by the Government Logistics Department (GLD) can meet the operational needs of government departments for up to two months, while the HA’s stockpile, taking into account the orders placed, is adequate for about three months, it said.The GLD is sourcing globally and has contacted more than 220 suppliers from over 10 countries. Economic and trade offices outside Hong Kong are in parallel identifying suppliers of surgical masks in their respective regions.In terms of local production, the Correctional Services Department will try to extend production of masks to 24 hours, increasing the production from 1.1 million to 1.8 million per month, while the Government has contacted the only local producer of surgical masks, which has already boosted its output from 800,000 a month to 1.6 million.Customs is also conducting citywide operations to combat masks with false origin claims, non-compliance with consumer goods safety standards and false trademarks.Regardingrumours claiming thatthe Governmentis hoarding a large number of masks, that the Home Affairs Department would distribute masks or even that the Chief Executive had approved the transfer of masks to Mainland authorities, the Governmentclarified that there was absolutely no truth in them.The Government said it will always take the health of Hong Kong people as the first consideration and thatit fully understands and will do its best to respond to public concerns about the supply of masks.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/01/20200130/20200130_183934_415.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
