But is there any other possibility that he might have had previous contact? We are still investigating.”The ambulanceman, like the female patient,lives in Lek Yuen Estate, Sha Tin. However, Dr Chuangruled out anoutbreak at the estate for now.“I do not think there is an outbreak in Lek Yuen Estate at the moment because the two cases in Lek Yuen Estate(involved a) couple, andthis one has a known contact with the case. So there are no other cases yet in Lek Yuen Estate at the moment.”The other two confirmed cases are women aged40 and36 who work with the34-year-old patient at awarehouse in Kwai Chung.“For the warehouse, I understand there is a hypothesis. That is why we also took samples from the packaging last night, from the food packaging and we have not found any positive result at the moment so we have no evidence to sustain this hypothesis at the moment.”Additionally, the Hospital Authority reported that 47 confirmed COVID-19 patients are currently hospitalised and 1,037 confirmed and suspected patients have been discharged.For information and health advice on COVID-19, visit the Government'sdedicated webpage.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200601/20200601_172540_508.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
1,"June 1, 2020",Private clinics urged to step up testing,Health & Community,"(To watch the full pressbriefing with sign language interpretation, clickhere.)The Department of Health today urged private doctors to be vigilant by offering COVID-19 testing forpatients who come to them with symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild.Briefing the media this afternoon, Under Secretary for Food & Health Dr Chui Tak-yi said the co-operation of doctors in the private sector is very important in identifying suspected cases.“There are maybe close to 7,000 doctors working in the private sector. So if they can be vigilant enough and also offer tests for patients who attend their clinic presenting with respiratory symptoms or mild symptoms that are suggestive of COVID-19, then of course that would become a very extensive network to facilitate community testing.“Noting that local infection cases have occurred sporadically, Dr Tsui called on members of the public to seek medical advice as soon as they develop respiratory or mildsymptoms, and proactively discuss with their doctors whether testing should be conducted.“We also would like to call for the alertness and also co-operation of citizens in general because many of them when they suffer from a very mild illness they may choose not to go to a doctor.“There are still sporadic local cases and also potential local clusters because we do not know yet how extensive this current cluster is, so we need time to establish and we cannot predict which local case can become a bigger local cluster.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200601/20200601_172932_638.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
2,"June 2, 2020",New COVID-19 cluster a concern,Health & Community,"(To watch the full media session with sign language interpretation, click here.)The Government is highly concerned about a COVID-19 community cluster linked to a Lek Yuen Estate resident as it reflects some characteristics not seen before and warrants more investigation into tracing the source of infection.Chief Executive Carrie Lam made the remarks ahead of today’s Executive Council meeting, adding that of particular concern was that the patients lived in the same building yet were not affected by thedrainage system or the building structures.“We have seen a lot of infections in family contacts. But in the workplace, we have seen a little bit (of it) in the workplace, in a bar, a band and so on. But in the environment, so living in the same building but not affected by the drainage system or the building structures, is something that gets me very worried and also I believe the experts.“So they have to do a lot more investigation to trace the causes of these infections and to receive as quickly as possible the specimens back, so that we have a better idea of the extent and the spread of the infections in the local community.“So with that background and new development, I said that we will adopt a very cautious and prudent approach in dealing with the various measures that we have put in place.”Mrs Lam noted the Government will also have to decide on whether to continue the various measures that will expire this month, including those enhancing social distancing in catering and business premises,prohibiting group gatherings, and the 14-day mandatory quarantine imposed on arrivals from the Mainland, Macau and Taiwan as well as from foreign countries.“I do not want to give a firm view yet because again, you know this is Tuesday, we have an Executive Council meeting to follow. But I can tell you that we will announce the decision very soon.""The Chief Executive also pointed out thatsuch restrictions are imposed for the sake of public health.“It is not a matter of taking away people’s freedoms. Actually public health is also part of national security. National security is not just about explosives and rifles. National security includes financial security, includes public health security.“So when it comes to matters like public security, people will accept, Hong Kong people willingly abide by some of the restrictions in order to protect themselves, their families and society at large.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200602/20200602_102813_625.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

That is, for those measures that we have put in place under Cap 599G and Cap 599F, we will keep it for another 14 days.”Prof Chan added that the Government has the responsibility to deal with the local cluster.“So therefore, we are looking into and considering the different factors based on public health and not other considerations.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200602/20200602_173816_679.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

So what they need to do is to join this type of programme, to have a mentor share their experiences and also, with a little help, they can flourish,” Ms Chan said.A renowned Hong Kong badminton player who won gold in the mixed doubles event at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Ms Chan retired as an athlete that year and became headmistress of the Jockey Club’s Apprentice Jockeys’ School in 2006.She explained that the winning mentality of athletes contributes to their success in other fields.“I really think that as athletes, they have all types of qualities - they are very, very hard-working, they have determination and they face challenges without any fear.""They will bring all these qualities to their new jobs.”Valuable lessonsMs Yip is now working as a sports promotion co-ordinator at a local school.

When she was young, she played badminton and was very focused and trained hard.“When she retired, she did not pick up any badminton coaching duties, she just changed her life direction. When I talked to her, I understood that when we have a goal and direction, we will be successful.”The Stars to Shine scheme was launched by the Hong Kong Athletes Career & Education Programme.Eight famous retired athletes who are now working in different industries joined the scheme as mentors when its first phase launched in 2018.Retired rugby player Candy Cheng was also a programme mentee. She is now the development and transition programme co-ordinator at the Hong Kong Rugby Union.Ms Cheng said she learnt about the public relations industry through her mentor, Vivian Lee, a former swimmer.“The interaction with Vivian and other mentors broadened my vision. Vivian has worked on a lot of PR and event management projects.“I think the interaction with my mentor gave me opportunities to meet more people, to see more things. This has inspired me to have different ideas in my current job.”Ms Lee, who won silver at the 1994 Asian Games, stressed former athletes should research different industries before they choose a career path.“Every person, they are very unique, they have different strengths and weaknesses. And in each industry, the requirements are different.“I would highly recommend them to take some opportunities, to really take up some internships or short-term contracts to explore what they really like.”The second phase of the Stars to Shine programme will be launched in October.Visit the Hong Kong Athletes Career & Education Programme website for more details.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200612/20200612_111501_439.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

And so in view of the lifting mode, we have to look at what is a number that is acceptable or the risk that is acceptable.“On the one hand, currently under Cap 599G, there are certain exemption categories that have a 50-people number, for example wedding ceremonies and also annual general meetings and extraordinary general meetings.“So far under these exemptions the compliance and everything is okay.

The health code actually means that you need to have, in your possession, a certificate to prove that you have a COVID-19 test which is negative, then you can travel without this 14-day mandatory requirement.""As far as the timing, we want to do it as soon as possible, but there are certain technical issues to overcome and the number of people that we will be allowing across the boundary every day, and so on. But I can tell you the detailed work covers both Guangdong and Macau.""I have personally spoken to Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, and both governments, the Hong Kong and Macau governments are also working very hard to achieve that sort of facilitating travel for our respective citizens. Hong Kong people want to go to Macau, Macau people need to come to Hong Kong for various businesses. So let me assure you that we attach a lot of importance, we are working very hard and we hope to be able to tell you the arrangement when we are in a position to do so.""",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200623/20200623_112654_641.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

65,"June 24, 2020","GD, HK discuss easing travel",Health & Community,"Secretary for Food & Health Prof Sophia Chan said today the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong are considering the launch of a pilot scheme to relax the cross-boundary flow of people between the two places within certain limits.Answering lawmakers’ questions in the Legislative Council today, Prof Chan said the COVID-19 outbreak in Guangdong Province has relatively subsided and the move wouldfacilitate people who need to travel between Guangdong and Hong Kong.She said the pilot scheme being discussed is expected to have restrictions on the number or coverage of people eligible for exemption in the initial phase.If there is a quota on the number of people, the two governments will consider a suitable mechanism for allocating the quota, such as through an open booking system.Furthermore, exempted people must not have left Hong Kong or Guangdong in the past 14 days preceding their departure.She noted that the two governments will mutually recognise the COVID-19 test results conducted by designated testing facilities which meet the standards.The mutual recognition will be done through the health code of the two places. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will develop a Hong Kong Health Code system, which enables the scheme participants’ virus test results in Hong Kong to be uploaded onto the code.Before leaving Hong Kong, eligible people with negative test results can connect to the electronic platform through a web browser using smartphones or mobile devices, and apply for the Hong Kong Health Code online and download it to their mobile phones or devices.To facilitate the mutual recognition of test results by Guangdong and Hong Kong boundary control officers, scheme participants can, of their own accord, choose to exchange the Hong Kong Health Code for use on Guangdong's Yuekang Code system for health declaration purposes when they enter the province.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200624/20200624_162331_807.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

68,"June 25, 2020",Lab plays key role in virus fight,Health & Community,"Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Programme, which provides free COVID-19 testing, has been extended from public hospitals, private clinics and airport arrivals to bus drivers to minimise the risk of community transmission.Deep throat saliva specimens are sent to the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch in Shek Kip Mei every day for testing.Medical Technologist Anita Ng recalled that the first confirmed case was discovered on her birthday, making it an exciting but hectic day for her.“We diagnosed it at around 5pm. Everyone was in a panic. We had to ask for another sample and do a lot of re-testing to confirm it.”Round-the-clock testingDuring the peak of the epidemic in Hong Kong, the number of tests carried out could reach as many as 4,000 per day. The laboratory also deals with urgent testing requests such as for the 1,800 passengers on the World Dream Cruise in February and the Luk Chuen House residents who were evacuated from the Sha Tin housing block earlier this month.“We had to try our very best to finish everything within a day. We ate for 10 minutes and then continued to test,” Ms Ng added.The tests are not limited to human specimens. Multiple worshippers at a Buddhist temple in North Point were infected in February, so the Department of Health sent staff to collect environmental specimens from common areas as well as objects such as scriptures and kneeling blankets.“The number of viruses in environmental specimens is usually low. We have to test at least 10 times per specimen to ensure it is a true negative,” explained Ms Ng.Self-developed technologyAccording to Public Health Laboratory Services Branch Scientific Officer Peter Cheng, nucleic acid testing is the most accurate testing method to identify COVID-19 to date.Upon arrival at the laboratory, the specimens undergo pre-analytical treatment. The technologists then extract the nucleic acid from the specimens and add master mix reagents for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Fluorescent signals can be detected during the process for the presence of the virus.Mr Cheng designed the primers and probes required for the test. The technology was approved by the Hong Kong Laboratory Accreditation Scheme.“The sensitivity is almost 100%. Even if there are only 200 copies of the virus per millilitre they can be detected. The specificity is also up to 100%. That means we do not have any problem of false positives or false negatives,” he said.As of June 16, more than 300,000 samples had been tested by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch and the Hospital Authority.To advance the identification of COVID-19 infected patients, the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Programme was further extended to cover bus drivers last week.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200623/20200623_201658_608.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
69,"June 25, 2020",Govt maintains support in virus fight,Health & Community,"Chief Executive Carrie Lam“Food is heaven to the people.” This well-known Chinese saying is particularly true in the case of Hong Kong which is a food paradise. The recent Father’s Day was the first Sunday after the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government lifted most social distancing measures affecting catering businesses. We were pleased to see that people went to restaurants to celebrate the day with family and friends, while restaurant owners and workers were much encouraged by the increase in business. Just asthe Honourable Tommy Cheung, the Legislative Council Member representing the catering sector said, it is hoped that catering businesses will employ more workers so that the unemployment rate of the catering industry can return to single digits.The above phenomenon illustrates how the suppress and lift strategy adopted by the Government to prevent and control the epidemic is applied when Hong Kong’s epidemic situation has stabilised. Our city has entered a new phase of relaxing restrictions while keeping public health risks in check. Economic activities of all sorts have gradually resumed and people’s lives have generally returned to normal. However, lifting those restrictions does not mean letting our guard down. Before the advent and widespread application of effective vaccines, we still have to stay alert and be well-prepared to make prompt responses whenever necessary.Developments of the epidemicHong Kong’s epidemic situation has remained stable with a total of 114 confirmed cases reported over the past month (from May 25 to June 24). Among them, 102 were imported cases, involving Hong Kong residents returning from overseas with the largest number from Pakistan, the Philippines, India and Bangladesh or their close contacts. All cases were detected because of the testing of inbound travellers from overseas. Since we have adopted a test and hold strategy, ie inbound travellers can only leave a designated location after receiving the virus test result, the chance of the virus spreading into the community has been minimised.However, during the period, the emergence of a local cluster of 12 confirmed cases, the source of which remains unknown, has caused considerable concerns. These 12 cases involved the family members, colleagues and residents living in the same housing block of the first confirmed patient. It was also the first time in Hong Kong that an ambulance officer was suspected of contracting the virus in the course of transporting an infected person to hospital. We were highly concerned as the scope of infection was rather broad. Staff and experts from the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) and relevant departments went to the scene immediately to conduct an inspection, trace contacts, carry out large-scale virus testing for high-risk people (including residents living in the same housing block, colleagues of the confirmed patients, etc), as well as to step up cleaning of facilities.As five confirmed patients were found to be living in the same units on different floors of the same block, for the sake of prudence, we evacuated 24 households living in those units to quarantine centres. In this cluster, the first case was confirmed on May 31 while the last one was confirmed on June 13. Much to our relief, no more infections have since been detected. Unfortunately, two elderly residents who were infected passed away recently to become the fifth and sixth COVID-19 deaths in Hong Kong. I would like to express my sincere condolences to their families.The intermittent emergence of local infection clusters reminds us once again of the presence of undetected infections in the community. It is imperative for the Government to step up virus testing to keep the epidemic in check through early identification, early isolation and early treatment.Anti-epidemic effortsAs the local epidemic situation has remained generally stable, following the direction we started to take last month, we have continued to relax anti-epidemic measures in a moderate and phased manner. On social distancing, K3 to S5 students have all resumed classes; public facilities and business premises (including the two theme parks) previously closed have been allowed to reopen subject to fulfilment of infection control requirements; the number of persons allowed in group gatherings in public places has also been relaxed fromeight to 50. With a weak economy and a rising unemployment rate, such relaxations are timely; they also help meet people’s aspiration to resume social life.As recommended by our experts, we have been stepping up virus testing to ascertain the presence of the virus in the community. In the first half of June, an average of 4,000 virus tests a day were conducted by public institutions, an increase of over 60% compared with May. Our short-term target is to enhance the testing capacity of public institutions to 7,000 virus tests a day. With the introduction of a “health code” to be used for travelling between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and a “travel bubble” to be set up with specific overseas countries, people’s demand for virus testing will increase significantly. The Department of Health (DH) is liaising with private institutions to help them enhance their testing capacity. Major measures implemented by the Government in response to developments over the past month are set out below:DateEventMay 26The Government announced that four types of business premises previously closed, including karaoke establishments, clubs or nightclubs, bathhouses and party rooms, could resume operation from May 29, subject to fulfilment of certain preventive measures, and transfer/transit services at Hong Kong International Airport would resume starting from June 1.May 26The Leisure & Cultural Services Department (LCSD) announced that its performance venues would be reopened from June 1 and all Music Office music centres would reopen for full service on the same day.May 27S3 to S5 students resumed classes.June 1The CHP under the DH issued a letter to all private doctors to remind them to arrange virus tests for patients with respiratory symptoms or other symptoms, even if the symptoms were mild.June 2In view of the emergence of new local cases, the Government announced that the existing disease prevention regulations and restrictions on catering premises and scheduled premises would be maintained and group gatherings of more than eight persons in public places would continue to be prohibited till June 18. The expiry date of the legislation on compulsory quarantine arrangements applicable to inbound travellers from the Mainland, Macau, Taiwan and overseas would be extended.June 8P4 to S2 students resumed classes.June 10The LCSD announced that more public swimming pools, gazetted beaches, libraries and museums would be reopened. The arrangement of opening alternate courts/tables of badminton courts, billiard/American pool rooms and table tennis rooms would be relaxed and booking applications for some land recreation and sports facilities and wedding venues would resume.June 15K3 to P3 and S3 to S5 cross-boundary students resumed classes. Arrangements would be made for cross-boundary students to take school buses to travel directly between the boundary control points and schools.June 16The Government announced that some social distancing measures would be relaxed from June 19 for a period of 14 days till July 2. The relaxation measures would include the following: the number of persons allowed in group gatherings in public places would be relaxed from eight to 50; list of exempted group gatherings would be expanded to include catering business premises subject to relevant infection prevention measures and restrictions; social distancing measures at catering business premises and scheduled premises would be relaxed, ie the limit on the number of persons allowed to be seated together at one table at catering business premises would be removed; the number of persons allowed to be seated together at one table in bars/pubs would be increased fromfour to eight persons; the limit on the number of persons at each facility/group/room at scheduled premises would be increased from eight to 16 persons; live performances and dancing activities would be allowed to resume subject to relevant infection control measures.June 17The LCSD announced that more leisure and cultural facilities and venues, including pitches and children facilities would reopen.June 18In view of the latest COVID-19 situation in Beijing, the Government announced that all inbound travellers arriving at Hong Kong International Airport from Beijing would be required to wait for test results at a designated location after submitting their deep throat saliva samples for virus testing and would be subject to compulsory home quarantine for 14 days should they test negative.Furthermore, the Government arranged several special flights in the past month to bring home over 900 Hong Kong residents stranded in India and Nepal.Striking the right balanceWe are fully prepared to fight an enduring battle against the virus and will continue to adopt the suppress and lift strategy to strive for the right balance. I once used the description “three-way tug-of-war” to illustrate the need to consider the three factors of public health, economic impact and social acceptance when making adjustments to our control measures. Striking the right balance is not an exact science and is easier said than done. We have to consider various factors and then act decisively. That said, let me make it clear again that political considerations absolutely play no part in such assessments. Therefore, the allegation that prohibiting group gatherings of over 50 persons involves consideration of suppressing protests and demonstrations is totally groundless. As a matter of fact, a variety of large scale activities, including ball games, open concerts, and even the annual dragon boat races, etc are affected by the same restriction.Anti-epidemic suppliesTo help our people to better fight this enduring battle, we arranged for free reusable masks, ie CuMask, to be provided for each Hong Kong citizen. The response was positive with a total of over 1.44million registrations received during the one-month registration period, covering more than 3.93 million people. The masks have been delivered to recipients by Hongkong Post. The Government has also directly delivered the CuMask to schools, residential homes and social welfare institutions for use by relevant individuals.In addition, from next week, a pack of 10 disposable masks will be distributed to each residential address in Hong Kong. These masks are the first batch of masks procured by the Government under the Local Mask Production Subsidy Scheme. We would like to share these masks with our people as part of our collective fight against the virus.Appealing for stability in Hong KongBattling this epidemic, I hope that people will cherish even more the hard-earned stable epidemic situation which has allowed us to revive our economy and improve local employment. In the same way, Hong Kong cannot stand chaos. Activities such as vandalism, advocating Hong Kong independence, illegal possession of explosives and firearms, etc have clearly threatened national security. The enactment of legislation for safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong SAR by the central authorities at the state level is to plug the loophole in our legal system and enforcement mechanisms so as to restore stability to our society as soon as possible and better protect national security. It is the constitutional responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR to safeguard national security, and also the common obligation of nationals of the entire country, including Hong Kong people.Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued thisarticle entitled Resuming Activities after Fighting the Virus for Five Months on June 25.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200625/20200625_154951_295.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
