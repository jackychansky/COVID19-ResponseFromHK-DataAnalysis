So, everybody should be very vigilant. For example, when they go to lunch, the advice is not to have lunch together, use more delivery services, and not gather together.“The issue of social distancing is still very important for people to observe. Using appropriate protective equipment, such as masks and also other personal protective clothing, when providing services are also important.”Prof Chan added that the move to have government staff resume work was scrutinised by experts.“The Chief Executive has an expert advisory group and this issue has been discussed with our experts during the previous meetings.The experts' advice is to provide more flexibility.“The protection as well as on how to maintain social distancing in a flexible manner when people start to work or to provide public services have also been discussed.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200302/20200302_142856_640.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

So we are in the process of doing that.""  Dr Chuang explained that the probe concerning the coronavirus infection cluster at the temple is time consuming because it involves several people.  “The whole investigation is still ongoing because there may be other people who have travel history as well.

Apart from distributing face masks and anti-epidemic supplies to them, I was also given a better understanding of the impact brought by the epidemic on their daily lives. To show our concerted support in the fight against the disease, the Department of Justice (DoJ) Staff Club organised a volunteer activity on Sunday, which I joined with my fellow colleagues in offering our help to those in need.To echo the Government's move to stay united, the DoJ Staff Club put forth a cash contribution campaign to buy anti-epidemic supplies for donation. The staff club volunteers acquired face masks and alcohol-based handrub in different ways - some were purchased through online shopping and some were bought at medicine stores. Last Sunday, I joined the volunteers in packing the anti-epidemic supplies, supermarket cash coupons and leaflets with health information. Our volunteers took the care packs in person to a non-governmental organisation a few days ago for passing to the elderly and low-income groups.The staff club has been participating in volunteer services now and then. Given the overwhelming response this time, I am glad to know that more volunteer activities would be organised in thefuture. I would definitely be joining as many as I could. Through offering our efforts to help those in need, we hope to show our care for the less privileged in society and contribute to building a caring and inclusive community.The public services of the DoJ, like all other government departments, have gradually resumed back to normal. I inspected the Justice Place on Monday to learn more about the infection control measures in place, such as the body temperature checking arrangement, provision of hand sanitisers and sanitising mats at building entrances.We must remain vigilant as the epidemic is still severe, and more importantly, we also need to stand in solidarity in the fight against the disease.Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng wrote thisarticle and posted it on her blog on March 5.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200305/20200305_111453_485.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The Centre for Health Protection today reported a confirmed case of COVID-19 involving a 38-year-old woman who was among the Hong Kong residents brought back from Hubei Province on a chartered flight.  While briefing the media on the city’s latest COVID-19 situation, the centre’s Communicable Disease Branch Head Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan said the risk of other people being infected will be low as the Government implemented measures to prevent cross infection throughout the entire return trip.  “I think this is the first (confirmed) case among those Wuhan returnees to Hong Kong. During their return, for the whole journey, all of the infection control measures had been in place to prevent any cross infection.  “As far as I understand, the risk to other returnees will be very low.”  Dr Chuang also responded to questions concerning the contact tracing of case a confimed case.  The COVID-19 patient, identified as the husband of the 105thcase, did not have a travel history and showed no virus symptoms even though his saliva tested positive on March 6.  “As he did not have any symptoms, we took the first date, when he had a positive saliva (test), to be the onset date. It is not just for contact tracing purposes.  “So we took March 4 and 5, those people who had contact with him, as possible close contacts. But during those two days he did not travel a lot, except for driving his wife to the Violet Peel General Out-patient Clinic. He mainly stayed at home.  “On March 5 we already transferred him to the quarantine centre. So there are not many other close contacts to be traced.”  Meanwhile, the centre is investigating an additional case of COVID-19, raising the number of confirmed cases in Hong Kong to 109.  The patient is a 73-year-old woman who is member of the same tour group as the two patients of the 105th and 107th cases confirmed on March 4 and 6.  She lives at Swiss Towers in Tai Hang. She travelled with her husband to India from February 4 to 19.  She was asymptomatic before she attended Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital yesterdaywhere her respiratory sample tested preliminary positive for COVID-19.  She was sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment on the same day. Upon further testing today, her respiratory sample tested positive for the virus.

The Centre for Health Protection today said it is working to develop a better method to combat COVID-19 by studying its route of transmission.  The centre’s Communicable Disease Branch Head Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan made thestatement at a press briefing while responding to a question about a prediction that the epidemic could persist through the end of this year.  “I am aware of the prediction and assessment by experts as well as the announcements by the World Health Organization. We understand there is a possibility that this disease will stay with us and may come and go.”  While Dr Chuang acknowledged thatCOVID-19 could have a long-term impact on Hong Kong, she explained the centre's contingency plans that include studying the nature of the virus.  “At present, because the disease is still new to us, we will try our best to delay the epidemic and the spread in Hong Kong to buy time to see whether we can (develop) a better method to fight against this disease, be it newer drugs or vaccines.  “When we understand more about the route of transmission and the disease’s nature, we will have better methods to deal with it.”  Amid the confirmation of four more COVID-19 cases in the city, Dr Chaungemphasised that the public can help reduce the spread of the virus by avoidingnon-essential travel.  “We are aware of the global situation, so it is very difficult for one place in Hong Kong to quarantine all travellers, all people coming from everywhere in the world.  “So we advise the public to try to delay unnecessary travel outside Hong Kong because there is a risk every place outside of Hong Kong, even in Hong Kong.  “When you travel to outside places, you never know whether there is an outbreak there, and there is also a risk associated with travelling itself – in the airplane and in the conveyances.  “If people delay their travel, then it would decrease the risk of imported cases, at least for Hong Kong residents.”  For information and health advice on COVID-19, visit the Government's dedicated webpage.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200308/20200308_173324_186.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) today said it is providing support to private medical practitioners and answering their enquiries on the enhanced laboratory surveillance with testing for COVID-19 at private clinics.  The centre's Communicable Disease Branch Head Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan told a press briefing this afternoon that only its microbiology laboratory and public hospitals can test for the virus, as there are currently no commercial kits available for the private sector.  ""Because we know that many people may not present with very severe symptoms or they may not have an epidemiological indicator that they are a case, so they may not be classified as a suspected case.  ""Then this patient with mild symptoms, just like a normal flu, they may go to visit their own doctors at the present moment, so private practitioners have no way to test them, except for referring them to the public hospital general outpatient or Accident & Emergency Department for admission.  ""In order to assist them, we will provide free testing to support the laboratories.""  Dr Chuang noted that private medical practitioners take throat samples to diagnose a patient's illness and send them to a laboratory, so the CHP hoped to normalise COVID-19 testing into thedoctors' practice.  ""If they take a sample from the patient they can send it to their own laboratory, and their laboratory can send the specimen to our laboratory so we can provide free testing - that's how it works.  ""We want to normalise the testing to suit their own practice. Of course, after we issued the letter last week, we understand many doctors are very concerned because this is a new thing and it's a new virus and new testing.""  The centre had sent a letter to private doctors to solicit their support to collect respiratory specimens from patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms, especially those with a travel history outside of Hong Kong within 14 days before the onset of symptoms.

Because as a household contact you usually share rooms and space - not necessarily sleeping in the same room - but they will have many household contact during the day.“As a driver of the case, I think they would have many contacts.

But for this person, she has special medical circumstances. Although she had two negative results, I understand the doctors were worried whether there will be intermittent or prolonged shedding of the virus.  “That’s why after she came back from Japan, she had a follow-up in Queen Mary Hospital and as a precaution, the doctor took a swab from her to check if she was carrying the virus.  “So it turned out to be positive.

The Centre for Health Protection reminded members of the public that several confirmed COVID-19 cases that were recently recorded in Hong Kong were related to a tour group to India.  This indicates the possibility of community transmission there.

37,"March 12, 2020",Pet dog blood test result released,Health & Community,"A blood test of a pet dog, which had earlier repeatedly tested weak positive for COVID-19, has shown a negative result, the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department announced today.  The department collected samples from the dog five times for tests since late February and detected low levels of the virus in its nasal and oral cavity samples.  A blood sample was taken from it on March 3 for a serological test, which resulted in a negative result, indicating that there is not a strong immune response and that there are currently not measurable amounts of antibodies in the blood.  The negative serological test result does not suggest that the dog is not infected with the virus.  It is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop. It is also not uncommon to have a negative result in the earlier stages of infection as it often takes 14 days or more for measurable levels of antibodies to be detected.  Another blood sample will be taken later for further testing.  Additionally, the department, together with the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, has conducted gene sequencing of the COVID-19 virus from the dog and its close human contacts who were confirmed to be infected.  They discovered that the viral sequences are very similar, indicating that the virus likely spread from the infected people to the dog.  The animal has not shown any signs of the disease and it is currently under quarantine at the animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge.

When compared to adults, they had less severe symptoms.”  Dr Lau noted the treatment modality would be based on past evidence, research and expert opinions.  “They try to summarise what happened in the past as well as the current information, current evidence that will be useful for making the recommendation of usage of anti-viral drugs including Kaletra as well as interferon for children.”  He said children would generally be treated according to their age and symptoms. If they exhibited mild symptoms they would be prescribed a supportive treatment.  The use of anti-viral drugs on those below the age of 12 would usually be avoided, unless the circumstances warranted their use, there was a clinical need, or the patient was in a serious condition, Dr Lau added.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200313/20200313_180049_928.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Basically, now there’re about maybe 1,600 (places) including the three blocks in Chun Yeung Estate. So with these very limited quarantine facilities, we have taken the view that they should be reserved for the high-risk cases.“So who are the high-risk cases? One is the close contacts of confirmed cases and - you don’t know, I don’t have a crystal ball - sometimes one confirmed case could give rise to 100 close-contact cases. So we have to reserve that capacity for the high-risk cases.“Secondly, from time to time, we have unforeseen incidents like this Tai Po Fu Heng Estate, Heng Tai House. It was an unforeseeable incident that suddenly we needed to evacuate (the residents) and put them into a quarantine centre because they were also high risk cases.“So from now on, I would say, the majority of arrivals in Hong Kong will be put under home quarantine or medical surveillance of some form.”While Mrs Lam emphasised that the Government will work to ensure people comply with quarantine rules, she called on those under home quarantine to exercise self-discipline.“We will do our best in terms of the monitoring, surveillance, telephone calls, WhatsApp location services and spot checks.“But at the end of the day, because of the large numbers involved, right now we already have over 20,000 active home quarantine cases, we are expecting more.“So I am appealing to individuals who are being put under home quarantine to have self-discipline, to observe the rules and requirements and protect themselves and their family members and ultimately, of course, protect Hong Kong from a major outbreak.”Mrs Lam explained that Hong Kong has been doing quite well with combating the virus in the last two months and should preserve the results that the city has made through joint efforts.“We will increase our staffing at various levels. I have asked for more civil servants, to be sort of enlisted, to join this anti-epidemic work both at the airport and in the various back offices to support the home quarantine work.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200317/20200317_111252_477.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

111,"March 25, 2020",CE urges vigilance,Health & Community,"Chief Executive Carrie LamIt has been two months since the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government raised the COVID-19 response level to the highest level of “Emergency” on January 25. A month ago, I wrote an article titled “Continue Our Fight Determined to Win” to report on our anti-epidemic work in the first month. Today, I would like to review with you the developments of the epidemic and the Government’s responses over the past month, as well as make some urgent appeals.Developments of the epidemicIn the period from mid-February to mid-March, the overall situation of the epidemic in Hong Kong was stable. There were almost no imported cases from the Mainland, and there were only single-digit new confirmed cases each day. If we exclude imported cases/cases with a travel history of Hong Kong residents and their close contacts, there were only sporadic local cases, and even zero local cases in 12 days. This shows that the whole community has a high awareness of disease prevention and has been vigilant in maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing, and the Government’s anti-epidemic measures have attained certain results.However, as the disease is rapidly spreading overseas, the number of confirmed cases and the speed at which it increases are terrifying. The global number of confirmed cases reached 100,000 on March 6, exceeded 200,000 on March 18, and subsequently increased to 300,000 in just three days and to 400,000 today in another three days. Following the outbreak in Korea earlier, outbreaks occurred within a short time in places like Europe and the United States, with Italy and Spain becoming the most heavily hit regions.Cumulative number of confirmed cases in selected countries in Europe and AmericaSince there is a huge difference in the population of every country and region, considering the number of confirmed cases alone may not reflect the severity of the epidemic in different places. The incidence rate of infection per million population is therefore a common indicator:Countries and regionsCumulative no. of confirmed casesPopulation (million)Incidence rate (cases per million population)Mainland China81,2181,435.056.6Italy69,17660.51,144.1United States of America44,183331.0133.5Spain39,67346.8848.5Germany27,43683.8327.5France22,30065.3341.6Korea9,13751.3178.2United Kingdom8,07767.9119.0Switzerland8,0158.7926.1Australia1,7095.5309.7Japan1,193126.59.4Singapore5585.995.4Hong Kong3877.551.6Taiwan21623.89.1Macau300.6546.2(Figures as at March 24)From the chart and table above, we can actually see that Hong Kong’s situation is better than quite a number of regions in Europe, America and Asia Pacific. During discussions and in literature regarding this disease, I always hear experts say that the Government should strive to flatten the curve. From the chart below, we can see that the curve for Hong Kong, before rising almost linearly in the recent ten days due to the large increase in imported cases, was quite flat. Yet, this relatively stable situation has changed since mid-March, which is worrying.Cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hong KongDue to the escalating epidemic and the gradual suspension of local universities and boarding schools in Europe and the United States, a large number of Hong Kong residents and students studying abroad returned to Hong Kong. This wave of return to Hong Kong led to a great increase in imported cases. In the past 14 days, close to 90% of confirmed cases (233 cases in total) either have been abroad or are close contacts of these confirmed cases. Just Hong Kong residents studying in the United Kingdom account for 28 confirmed cases.The expert advisory panel of the Government’s Steering Committee& Command Centre pointed out that although the drastic increase in number of cases is worrying, Hong Kong can still contain the epidemic as long as we step up the containment strategy adopted previously and have the support of the general public.Anti-epidemic effortsThe inter-departmental Steering Committee& Command Centre chaired by me has remained vigilant over the past month. During the time when the infection situation was rather stable, we still kept a close watch on the developments of the epidemic in the local community and in other places of the world. We also made use of the opportunity to make necessary preparations for future anti-epidemic work. These include enhancing community surveillance through free virus tests, providing more isolation and quarantine centres, increasing the production and procurement of surgical masks and other personal protective equipment, and implementing over 20 initiatives under the Anti-epidemic Fund to support the sectors and members of the public hard hit by the epidemic. In the first half of March when the epidemic became more serious, we acted promptly and implemented numerous measures to cope with the situation within a short period of time.Major measures implemented by the Government to respond to the developments of the epidemic in the past month are set out in the following table.DateEventFebruary 28Issuing the Red Outbound Travel Alert (OTA) on three regions in Italy, and issuing quarantine orders to people arriving in Hong Kong who have been to the above three regions or to Iran where the Red OTA remains in force in the past 14 days (regardless of whether they are Hong Kong residents) starting from March 1.February 28The Hospital Authority (HA) extended the EnhancedLaboratory Surveillance Programme to cover patientsbelow 18 years old and those with fever or respiratorysymptoms subject to clinical assessment of physicianin charge.March 2Government bureaus/departments gradually resumed more public services with the implementation of targeted measures to reduce social contact and infection control measures.March 4Hong Kong residents returning to Hong Kong fromthe Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan completedquarantine by batches.

Four environmental samples tested positive later.March 15Issuing the Red OTA on Ireland, the United Kingdomand the United States, and issuing quarantine orders topeople arriving in Hong Kong who have been to theabove countries or to Egypt where the Red OTAremains in force in the past 14 days (regardless ofwhether they are Hong Kong residents) starting fromMarch 19.March 17Issuing the Red OTA on all overseas countries/territories and issuing quarantine orders to people arriving in Hong Kong who have been to the above countries/regions in the past 14 days (regardless of whether they are Hong Kong residents) starting from March 19.19 MarchHong Kong residents returning to Hong Kong from Hubei Province completed quarantine by batches. Only one of them was confirmed to be infected.March 19The CHP extended the Enhanced Laboratory Surveillance Programme to cover inbound travellers under quarantine from overseas. Priority was accorded to persons under quarantine aged 65 or above or persons under quarantine residing with elderly aged 65 or above.March 19To handle a large number of people arriving in Hong Kong via the Hong Kong International Airport, the HA established test centres at the AsiaWorld-Expo and North Lantau Hospital. People arriving in Hong Kong with upper respiratory symptoms will undergo virus tests and wait for the laboratory results there. Subject to the test results, they will be admitted to hospital or subject to home quarantine.March 20The Immigration Department closely monitored anti-epidemic measures implemented by the Moroccan authorities and rendered assistance to Hong Kong residents stranded in the country.March 21Announcing enhanced measures to control the disease, which include:The HA and the DH will fully utilise all resources for testing and enhance testing for people returning to Hong Kong from overseas;Resuming the special work arrangements for civil servants implemented before March 2to provide limited-scale public services;Deferring the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education examination;Stepping up enforcement actions against contravention of quarantine orders;Strengthening disease prevention at residential care homes for the elderly and people with disabilities.March 21Announcing adjustments to the health quarantine arrangements on people arriving in Hong Kong from Hubei Province (except Wuhan) to reserve more quarantine facilities for the close contacts of confirmed cases.March 23Announcing more anti-epidemic measures, which include:Starting from March 25, all non-Hong Kong residents coming from overseas countries and regions by plane will be denied entry to Hong Kong; non-Hong Kong residents coming from the Mainland, Macau and Taiwan will be denied entry to Hong Kong if they have been to any overseas countries and regions in the past 14 days; all transit services at Hong Kong International Airport will be suspended; and all travellers coming from Macau and Taiwan will be subject to compulsory quarantine;Stepping up virus testing for arriving persons from the United Kingdom, other countries in Europe and the United States;Taking stringent enforcement actions to combat breaches of quarantine orders;Strengthening social distancing measures, including a proposal to introduce legislation to temporarily prohibit the sale and supply of alcoholic drinks by restaurants, bars and clubs.March 24Stepping up enforcement against breaches of quarantine orders and appealing to the public to make use of the “e-Report Room” online platform to report breaches.March 25Sending the second batch of chartered flights to takeHong Kong residents stranded in Hubei Province backto Hong Kong.We have adhered to the people-oriented principle throughout our anti-epidemic work and have proactively supported Hong Kong people affected by the epidemic. For example, we overcame all kinds of challenges to bring back Hong Kong people stranded in Hubei Province by batches; we sent a special team comprising immigration officers and healthcare officers to take care of the Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers who stayed in Japan to receive medical treatment; and we provided support to Hong Kong residents who were stranded in Morocco and Peru. We also exercised discretion to extend the stay of carers on two-way permit in Hong Kong and prioritised the handling of Speedpost items containing surgical masks. We co-operated with the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions to deliver prescription medications to Hong Kong people in the Mainland and introduced a flexible arrangement to extend the validity period of the contracts of foreign domestic helpers, etc.We have also continued to uphold the principle of operating in an open and transparent manner in our anti-epidemic efforts. Through the daily press conferences by the CHP and the HA, media sessions by the Chief Executive and secretaries of departments and directors of bureaus, the designated website “coronavirus.gov.hk”, the Facebook pages of the CHP and “Tamar Talk”, the Interactive Map Dashboard, social media and more, we provide the public with the latest information on the disease and clarify rumours. The Interactive Map Dashboard is very popular and has attracted about 16 million views since its launch.Fighting the virus togetherIn the face of the severe situation of the epidemic, I would like to once again thank all the healthcare and government anti-epidemic officers (including auxiliary forces, retired civil servants and volunteers) who fight the disease at the forefront. I would like to alsothank the four professors on the expert advisory panel and the research and development teams of universities and innovation and technology companies for making suggestions on the prevention and control of the disease as well as our citizens who have put up with the inconvenience in their daily lives to safeguard Hong Kong. All of them are our anti-epidemic heroes. The governing team and I will stay committed to our duties, remain calm and stay vigilant in our fight against the disease.To win the battle against the disease, the continuous support and co-operation of every Hong Kong citizen are of the utmost importance. We believe that a large number of Hong Kong citizens will continue to come back Hong Kong in the following weeks because of the worsening situation overseas and hence confirmed cases will inevitably continue to increase. The situation will be more severe and difficult to handle than any period in the past two months and may even lead to large-scale and a continuous outbreak in the community. This is a critical moment in the fight against the disease and also a moment for testing the resilience of Hong Kong people in the face of the epidemic.Fighting the virus is a long battle and the process is arduous. It is not easy to stay at home for a long period of time without normal activities and social interactions, but it is definitely not the time to let our guard down, otherwise the hard efforts of Hong Kong citizens in the past two months will be undone and the consequences could be dire. I appeal to all members of the public to continue to fight the disease together. I have no doubt that as long as we stay united, work together and support each other, Hong Kong will finally win the battle against the disease.Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued this article ""Two Months into Our Fight,Continue to Stay Vigilant"" on March 25.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200325/20200325_201157_173.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

That was the critical point.""He noted that the Government would be unable to meet its obligations in terms of payment for services and goods if the Vote on Account Resolution did not get this passed this week.There will be also a serious impact on the anti-epidemic work, Mr Lau added.""For that reason, if we have orders for what we call personal protective equipment, like masks, isolation gowns, face shields or protective coveralls, a lot of these would require cash payment or payment immediately upon delivery of services or goods.""That is why we believe that if the Vote on Account Resolution is not passed this week, there will be a very serious adverse impact on the anti-epidemic work that we undertake.""",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200325/20200325_124851_867.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Up till today at 6pm, we have been operating for five and a half days. We have tested around 370 cases and 13 of them tested positive. So in other words, we have saved around 350 beds - isolation bed facilities.“In the past, these patients with travel history and symptoms would be admitted to our isolation facilities for further investigation and treatment.“Because we have an increasing pressure on the need for isolation rooms, this is why we started the pilot project to set up the testing centres in AsiaWorld-Expo and also North Lantau Hospital.“So for patients who need a bit more medical attention, such as the elderly, we will send those patients to North Lantau Hospital. For younger patients - fit and young with mild symptoms, we will order an investigation in the AsiaWorld-Expo.“We find that this setup has helped to alleviate the pressure on our in-patient isolation facilities. So that is why we are also trying to set up similar triage and test centres in some of our accident and emergency departments in hospitals.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200325/20200325_180139_703.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

In the context that the second batch of returnees is from cities outside Wuhan within Hubei Province, we made the decision that this second batch of returnees from Hubei would require home quarantine.”Dr Chui said the Government, in considering the infection risk, had looked at the figures reported publicly - both on the Mainland and overseas - and noticed that from early this month until now, the number of new cases on the Mainland had dropped significantly to double digits per day, compared to a steep rise overseas.“The number of new cases in many places in other parts of the world has risen very steeply. The new cases per day may be hundreds, thousands and many thousands, and the trend is increasing.“Definitely from this trend, you can conclude that the relative risk of people coming from the Mainland versus those coming from overseas is different. It is certainly higher in say, March for people coming back from overseas places.“So it is a conclusion that perhaps in March, especially in the recent one or two weeks, the risk of Mainland returnees is definitely lower than that of people coming back from overseas.”He added that tests on more than 400 Hubei returnees had also provided a reference for the level of infection risk in bringing people back from the province.“There is only one confirmed case so far out of the 460-odd people returning from Wuhan and Hubei. So that is also one figure worth noting and that may tell us the level of risk as a reference.”Dr Chui reiterated that the second batch of Hubei returnees would still undergo stringent health checks throughout the whole process of returning to Hong Kong.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200326/20200326_175200_059.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The four bars involved are All Night Long, Centre Stage, Dusk Till Dawn and Insomnia.“We consider that all the members of the band, as well as the pub members, they may have had quite significant close contact with each other.

This is in line with the amount of virus genetic material in the samples.Further serological tests have been conducted at the World Health Organization reference laboratory at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on the blood sample taken on March 3 and the final test result is positive.This indicates that the Pomeranian had developed an immune response to the viral infection with antibodies found in the blood.Veterinary experts and scientists from the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine & Life Sciences of City University, as well as the School of Public Health of (HKU) concluded that the result further supported that the Pomeranian had been infected with the COVID-19 virus.The AFCD also stressed that cases of infection in dogs appear to be infrequent. As at yesterday, the department conducted tests on 17 dogs and eight cats from households with confirmed COVID-19 cases or people in close contact with the patients, and only two dogs tested positive for the virus.These findings indicate that dogs and cats are not easily infected with this virus and there is no evidence that they play a role in its spread.As COVID-19 is a newly emerged disease and the situation is still evolving, the department said a precautionary approach is being taken in quarantining animals from households with confirmed COVID-19 human cases.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200326/20200326_210657_932.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Some of them had symptoms and some were asymptomatic. Because we distributed saliva bottles to them, they handed in the bottles and were detected to have asymptomatic infection.“So it is not necessarily the planes they took that transmitted the disease. Most likely, they came from the United Kingdom where there is a major outbreak. Many of them volunteered epidemiological information concerning their contact in the UK, for example, gatherings, contacts with confirmed cases or cases with respiratory symptoms.”Dr Chuang explained that as quite a number of COVID-19 patients were found to be asymptomatic during the incubation period, returning travellers should adhere to home quarantine measures.“The proportion of asymptomatic infections is indeed worrying because if we know there are travellers, then we can test them or offer testing, but we can’t offer testing for the general population without any epidemiological links. So it is a very difficult situation to catch all of the cases in the community. That’s why we need social distancing and all these drastic legal measures.“If they develop symptoms, they should call our hotline and we will arrange admission if they have symptoms. If they do not have symptoms, if they have (saliva) bottles, they should ask their friends or relatives to bring the bottles to our collection points.“I also understand that some of them, they have put themselves under home isolation - for those who came back before March 19 - and that is a good practice that should be encouraged. And many of them phone their general practitioners without seeing them, and ask them to deliver the bottles to them. This is also a good alternative.”For information and health advice on COVID-19, visit the Government's dedicated webpage.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200328/20200328_172308_875.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

147,"March 31, 2020",Hospitalisation delay being addressed,Health & Community,"(To watch the full media session with sign language interpretation, click here.)Chief Executive Carrie Lam today saidit is unsatisfactory that some patients are not sent straight tohospital as soon as they arediagnosed with COVID-19 and she hoped the second-tier isolation ward beds beingmade availablewould help alleviate the situation.Speaking to reporters ahead of an Executive Council meeting this morning, Mrs Lam noted the delay in sending COVID-19 patients straight to hospital stemmed froma large number ofoverseas arrivalsbeing placed onhome quarantine.“It is not satisfactory for confirmed cases not to be admitted into hospitals yet. But this phenomenon appears because we have a large number of arrivals from overseas who have been put on home quarantine, which means that upon arrival, they have no symptoms. So they have been put on home quarantine.“In order to play safe, we require each of them to go through a saliva test. So as and when the saliva test is confirmed positive, then this patient becomes a confirmed case, but he or she is still staying at home.“So there needs to be a process to arrange for this confirmed positive patient to be admitted into hospital.”Mrs Lamadded that she has requested the Secretary for Food & Health to look into speeding up the process of sending patients straight to hospital once they tested positive for the virus.“The problem now lies in that capacity constraint in the hospitals to admit patients in a speedier manner. I have asked the Secretary for Food & Health to work very closely with the Hospital Authority to speed up the process as much as possible.“Isuspect the addition of the 400 second-tier isolation beds very soon in the Hospital Authority will help to provide more capacity to handle the situation.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200331/20200331_103949_358.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
148,"March 31, 2020",Mainland curbs remain: CE,Health & Community,"(To watch the whole media briefing with sign language interpretation, click here.)The Government has no plans to loosen any controls placed on people arriving from the Mainland, despite a low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported there.Chief Executive Carrie Lam made the statement ahead of today’s Executive Council meeting when asked if the Government would consider relaxing some of its control measures or re-open boundary control points as a result of the Mainland’s drop in new coronavirus cases.“Actually the great majority of these confirmed cases in the Mainland, recently, are imported cases. So logically, especially given our constraints in managing the home quarantine cases and so on, there may be some justification for relaxing some of the control requirements.“But my reply is ‘no’. For the time being, we have no plans to loosen any of the controls being put on arrivals from the Mainland.“One is, the situation is very fluid, it may still change. Secondly, after all of these control measures - closure of boundary control points in position of the 14-day quarantine, not only with the Mainland, but also now with Macau - we are seeing a significant drop in a number of arrivals, whether they are Hong Kong residents or non-Hong Kong residents coming in from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge as well as the Shenzhen Bay control point. So there isn’t a huge need for relaxing the boundary control points.“And thirdly, the regulation applicable to Mainland arrivals, which is (Hong Kong Laws Chapter) 599C, will expire. You may remember that all of these regulations are time-limited. This particular one will expire in early May.”Mrs Lam also pointed out that the quarantine rules for Mainland arrivals are set to expire in May.“So even if we do nothing by early May, this regulation will lose its effectiveness and then we will be able to resume some of the traffic flow without this 14-day quarantine requirement.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200331/20200331_104228_410.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

The other four cases had the onset of symptoms on March 27 to 28, so it is possible that they had some type of transmission during the event. The other two friends will be put under quarantine.”Dr Chuang noted that further investigations were needed to understand whether this group had any contact with staff at the karaoke bar.“Because usually in a karaoke setting they would be given a room and the staff usually do not have very close contact with them. But we have to check with the management to understand.“If it is just an isolated room without contact with other staff or other clients, I think the possibility of other cases is not very high.”She added that the centre still had to closely monitor the situation and find out more about the exact setting of the karaoke bar.The centre also announced it isinvestigating32additional confirmed COVID-19 cases, involving 19 males and 13 females aged 11 to 86.Among them, 24 had a travel history during the incubation period and 13 are overseas students.For information and health advice on COVID-19, visit the Government'sdedicated webpage.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/03/20200331/20200331_174138_425.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
