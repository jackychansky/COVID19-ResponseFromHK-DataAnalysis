So it may be related to the number of travellers.""But it can also be related to the low number of tests being done during the holiday because the general out-patient clinics are closed during the holiday and many of the general practitioners also close their clinics, so there would be fewer specimens sent from the patients.""She also cautioned against complacency despite the drop in the number of reported infections.""Because in the recent few days we have seen a lot of people coming out, we cannot exclude the possibility of a further outbreak in one or two weeks’ time, but it may not be tomorrow because there is a lap time of incubation period for this virus.""For information and health advice on COVID-19, visit the Government's dedicated webpage.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/04/20200413/20200413_182943_124.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

62,"April 19, 2020",Employment support is vital,Health & Community,"Secretary for Labour & Welfare Dr Law Chi-kwongAs we all know, Hong Kong as well as most parts of the world are facing a pandemic that has an enormous negative impact on our social and economic life. At this juncture, we don't have any accurate way to predict what will happen in the coming months. Two months ago, we were worried about whether COVID-19 would become a pandemic. Yet, the scale of the pandemic as we see now is not what we could have imagined two months ago. What we can do now is tackle the social and economic crisis upfront and build the resilience of our society, in particular, our employment market, so that when the time comes where social and economic activities can resume no matter how gradually or rapidly, our society can bounce back as soon as possible.Unemployment has edged up bit by bit since the latter part of 2019. Statistics and daily news about business closures are telling us that unemployment is going up rapidly. While we should see what can be done to help those unemployed, the more important and urgent task is to see how we can ""stop the bleeding"", which essentially means job retention. The Employment Support Scheme, with a budget of over $80 billion, is designed exactly for that purpose. Through providing time-limited financial support, the whole idea of this scheme is to preserve jobs by enabling employers to keep their employees in employment for the coming months, and also when business resumes, employers can immediately grab the opportunities.The central idea of the Employment Support Scheme is to provide wage subsidy that is equivalent to 50% of the wages of the employees up to a wage cap of $18,000 per month. The subsidy is given to the employers so that they can keep their staff for the coming six months. The employers will be required to have no redundancy or layoffs during the months that they receive wage subsidies from the Government.In Hong Kong, we do not have a pay-as-you-go income tax system. Neither do we have a social insurance system nor a central provident fund to cover everyone in our workforce. That means we do not have any existing system covering every employer and employee in Hong Kong that we can devise a wage subsidy scheme that covers everyone. Any system meant to cover everyone in our workforce must be mandatory in nature and that will take time for us to have the relevant legislation in place and subsequently the system built.However, schemes under the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) and the other Occupational Retirement Schemes provide a framework that we can develop a wage subsidy scheme to cover the great majority of the workforce. This is definitely not sufficient. In particular, we have identified three sectors that do not have good coverage in the provident fund systems. They are the catering industry, the construction industry and the passenger transport sector. Under the Anti-epidemic Fund, we have three sector-specific schemes to assist the employers and the employees in these sectors.Many freelance workers or those in the so-called slash economy do not make contributions to the MPF. Though we have over 200,000 self-employed persons having an account in the MPF system, they do not pay MPF regularly. While we will provide a one-off wage subsidy to those self-employed persons who have made MPF contributions within the past 15 months, we also have three separate but mutually exclusive schemes operating under the Home Affairs Bureau, the Education Bureau and the Social Welfare Department, providing the same one-off wage subsidy to those freelance workers who provide arts and sports training. The one-off wage subsidy is $7,500.Though all the schemes I mentioned above still cannot cover everyone in the workforce, this is the best we can do in making use of existing systems so that we can launch this round of the Anti-epidemic Fund in the shortest possible time to help our employers and employees to survive the challenges that are with us now. Any new systems to be built from scratch will not be able to provide the necessary timely support that employers and employees desperately need.As mentioned earlier, unemployment is increasing at a disturbing rate. The basic unemployment protection system in Hong Kong relies on two legs. One is the Severance Payment or Long Service Payment payable by the employers, which is equivalent to two-thirds of the monthly salary times the number of years of service with the employer. The other is the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) Scheme. The CSSA provides a level of income support to families for their basic level of living in the context of Hong Kong. The CSSA provides a safety net to any family not having sufficient means, including those who are unemployed.Apart from the income test, the CSSA also has an asset test. For the purpose of providing extra help to those unemployed during this difficult time, the Government will double the existing asset limit for the able-bodied for a limited period of six months, allowing more families with people unemployed to become eligible to receive CSSA. We estimated that about 40,000 families will benefit from this enhancement.Unfortunately, over the years there is a social stigma towards the CSSA system. People in desperation may be deterred from applying for CSSA simply because of the stigma. This is the time for us to destigmatise the CSSA system. It is the safety net for citizens of Hong Kong. It is the responsibility of an affluent society like Hong Kong to provide the basic level of living to those who cannot afford to do so on their own. This is the time, this difficult time, that this safety net should perform its basic function.We are doing our best to support Hong Kong in this epidemic fight. Let's weather the storm and brave the challenges together.This is theLetter to Hong Kong by Secretary for Labour & Welfare Dr Law Chi-kwong on anti-epidemic measures and the Employment Support Scheme carried on Radio Television Hong Kong Radio 3 on April 19.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/04/20200419/20200419_170735_285.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

So if there is, we will trace further and put them under quarantine and so on.”Dr Chuang added that this example and other locally acquired COVID-19 cases suggest that there are still infected people, silent carriers, who do nothave symptoms but are spreading the virus in the city.“The detection of locally acquired cases reflects that there is some silent transmission in the community. Whether it is large scale or small scale, it depends on our surveillance system and also our further tracing of the cases, contact tracing.”There are altogether two cases confirmed, with another as an imported case.

So therefore, in considering what to suppress and what to lift, we think this 50% requirement can be lifted for the time being.”Prof Chan emphasised that while the number of confirmed cases appears to have stabilised in recent days, social distancing measures will remain to safeguard the public from any sudden changes in the COVID-19 situation.“I think social distancing is one of key measures that we (implemented) to prevent the spread of the virus in the community or prevent a community outbreak.

So therefore, they can wait there for this to be implemented.“But for flights of which we cannot control the time and also with arrival times scheduled in the afternoon or even in the evening, we want to provide a better resting area for people who have to wait overnight for the results. Therefore, we think a hotel would be appropriate for this purpose of waiting.”She noted that the Centre for Health Protection would give health talks to help the nearby community understand the situation.“The Department of Health has been trying its very best to find hotels that are suitable and have an appropriate infection control environment and other measures that are appropriate in terms of facilities. It is actually not easy.""We found this hotel and we have informed the District Council. I understand there are sentiments or questions from the community as well as the District Council. We will do our best to provide more information to explain to them, to answer their queries and also to provide them with information. The Centre for Health Protection is organising health talks, so that the community can better understand the situation.”Prof Chan made it clear that the hotel would only for used as a waiting centre and that any traveller who tested positive for the virus would be sent straight to hospital.“This is not a quarantine centre, it is a centre for waiting for the results, or we say it is a holding centre for waiting for the results. So people who are (put) there, they shall stay there after taking samples at the airport and just go there to wait for the results. Because the flight arrives in the afternoon or in the evening, they need to wait overnight.“All of them will only stay one night at the hotel and they cannot go out. There will be special transportation to take them from the airport to the hotel. After they know the results then they can go back to their quarantine place if it is negative. If it is a confirmed case, obviously they will be sent to the hospital.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/04/20200421/20200421_124143_811.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

There has been interest in whether the testing can be extended to (cover) antibody tests which are quite expensive for a viral infection - apart from the PCR tests, which have been the gold standard as of now for the testing of coronavirus.“This has been raised by a colleagues, including from the medical community, from private doctors, etc to address this issue of some antibody tests for the coronavirus that has been circulating in the community, not only in Hong Kong, but also overseas.”Dr Wong also noted that antibody testing is neither validated nor standardised.“I would like to point out that at this point in time for the diagnosis of coronavirus infection, it remains PCR tests, not antibody tests because it’s not as timely as the PCR tests (at revealing) positive (results) within the infection.“And also, up till now, we understand that the sensitivity, in particular the specificity of the antibody or serology tests for the coronavirus have not been validated or standardised.”",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/04/20200421/20200421_172731_665.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t

Both of them travelled during the incubation period.Epidemiological investigations and relevant contact tracing on confirmed cases are ongoing.Elaborating on the case involving the 58-year-old man, the centre said it will quarantine service apartment cleaners and carry out coronavirus testing on workers at a dentist’s office.The centre’s Communicable Disease Branch Head Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan explained at a press briefing that such precautionary measures must be taken after the male patient, case number 1036, visited a dentist once he completed home quarantine.While the patient also visited a barber shop, Dr Chuang noted that the risk of infection to workers there is low because they all wore masks and their contact with the patient was minimal.“Concerning case number 1036, after he finished home quarantine, he did visit a few places and we are concerned. First, he visited a dentist on April 9 and second, he visited a barber shop on April 21.“There is a slight risk for transmission to other people. He did wear a mask and all the people who served him had worn full personal protective equipment (PPE).“Because he visited the dentist around 14 days ago, he was already past one incubation period. So we will arrange for those healthcare workers who had cared for him to be tested.“And for the barber shop, the risk for (staff) to become (COVID-19) cases is still very low. I mean their contact (with the patient) was minimal as (they all) had masks on.”Dr Chuang emphasised that those who cleaned the patient’s apartment will be placed under quarantine because they are at a higher risk of catching COVID-19.“He also had a few (service apartment) cleaners in his room to help with cleaning. We consider those three cleaners (as being) at the highest risk, so we will put them under quarantine.”The centre urged the public to maintain an appropriate social distance from other people and go out less to reduce the chance of coming into contact with infected people.For information and health advice on COVID-19, visit the Government's dedicated webpage.",https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/04/20200423/20200423_165102_799.html?type=category&name=health&tl=t
